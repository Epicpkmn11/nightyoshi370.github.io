Typically, when a school gets closed, they would try to hault learning or push on a ton of homework. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led the United States of America into a major lockdown, which has also affected how students would get their information. As such, school managers have been looking to make ways where students could still learn but at the same time, listen to the health experts. The proposed solution right now is to force everyone to use a video streaming service to attend specific classes at a specific time, which is what we used to do when we were in person. However, why keep to such an outdated system in a digital world that clearly does not need this?

Schools generally do not like change, and during these risky times, change could have a major impact on how the student can learn. Besides, with plans for a vaccine to come out really soon, is it that worth it to change what already works? But here's the thing; it does not work. There are severe issues when it comes to adapting a student-life into a kid's personal life. Administration does not know what stays behind closed doors, and unfortunately, students are weary of telling staff what goes on at home. However, staying behind those closed doors won't make a change; rather, describing the issues and taking this issue hands on will. Just because it's better than going to meet in person and getting everyone sick doesn't mean we have to love what we get. We're allowed to complain, and as long as these protests are peaceful, I see no reason why we cannot raise our voices to point out the issues with the current way of distanced learning.

### Global Services

Whether it's Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Speaks or whatever public service they use, it seems as if all schools are sticking to the tech giants due to peer recommendation. Normally, I applaud trying to limit your options to what works, what doesn't and what everyone else is picking. However, when you take bandwidth, server strain and independence into account, you could start to see why it's an issue. Allocating everyone into one basket means that security breaches are a much bigger deal than what would normally be if everyone spaced out, [which is exactly what happened with Zoom back in May 2017](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/passwords-email-addresses-thousands-zoom-accounts-are-sale-dark-web-n1183796?cid=googlenews-tech).

"So what? It's just zoom that got compromised. It's not like anyone sticks to it"<br>
Yes, it's just Zoom for smart guys who use different passwords for different services or use a password manager. However, the average market that Zoom appeals too (which, ironically enough, was no one before COVID-19) have really bad memory when it comes to passwords. Reusing passwords is common for folks like them. The issue then grows from just Zoom to Facebook, GMail and worse of all; your bank account. Now multiply that number from one person with the compromised account to all the peer-recommendations. The bigger a service grows, so does the hackers attention on it.

Now, yeah, this applies to everything really, but there are other issues in regards to server handling. If everyone is joining the same specific website at the same specific time, the server would have extreme difficulties keeping up with all the different requests thrown at it. That means that the server must be capable of handling all these requests, which wasn't the case back in April 2020 with Zoom's servers. Some schools have learned from this and switched over to other services to make server flow more balanced, but the issue still remains; we're using centralized services that schools have no control over.

These schools get funding for large scale building repairs, College Board makes over 1 billion dollars (yet they call themselves a non profit organization ðŸ˜‚) and yet, they can't afford to host their own systems? It's so easy to find a self-hostable alternative to Zoom and use that. Heck, my friend Evie hosted an entire chat platform on his Pi, which comes to show just how little demanding these platforms are. If you don't want to shell out money on a VPS, you could just buy your own cheap laptop, set up the platform and portforward your IP so that everyone can connect.

### Fast-internet access (or rather the lack-thereof)

Now that uptime relies purely on whether the school building's electricity is available in time for class and not if someone completely outside your life decided to try and DDOS a global service, it's time for the students to connect to the video conference platform you just set up. How is that going to work, when rural communities do not have access in the slightest to fast WiFi? Fiber is a game changer, yet that isn't available to most rural areas.

Take Oklahoma for example. A GBAtemp user named sks316 lives there and for the longest time, it's been really difficult for them to even stream basic youtube videos. With an upload speed of 0.88 mbps, I highly doubt she would have been able to even log onto Zoom, with how bloated their software is. Yet, her family paid $65 for speeds like this, so how could we expect low-income families to come to school every day using lesser wifi (if they could even afford wifi in the first place)?

If you don't like this comparison about Oklahoma, then let's take a look at Australia. How is it that in 2014, having a 2.66 Mbps upload speed is faster than 69% of the general population? Fiber literally just got announced on September 23rd, 2020 for Australian users, so for it to actually be usable would take quite a while. By that point, I'm sure we all would have come back to inperson schooling.

### Connection Issues (Technological-wise and otherwise)

Say that we somehow get everyone on fast wifi so that they are now able to connect. Oh wait, we now have connection issues and issues with staying in the class.

On September 2020, California went under a state of emergency due to a fire started by a Gender Reveal party. The power went off for an hour where I live, which is almost an entire class period. Thankfully, this happened on a weekend with no school, yet what happened if it took place on a school day? Schools would not be understanding of the situation.

We got a warning from our English teacher that says "if you leave during class, you're getting an F for that day's participation and you get a double diamond referral". Yet, if you don't connect at all, you just get an "Absent" grade? What's the difference? Just give them the absent and be done. Why penalize someone who at least stayed for a bit harsher than someone who didn't come at all?

### Is video-conferencing needed?
Say we we somehow got everything worked out and everything works out just fine. Now what? We waste our battery watching something we could easily do on our own?
For example, my English teacher was attempting to stream a movie called Boys State over this service, which is not only piracy aka **illegal**, but the recording is at 5 frames per second which is such an eye sore that I physically cannot watch the movie. I do not expect 120 FPS (let alone 60 FPS) but at the bare minimum, 15fps seems to be better than this.

Do we really need in-person classes 99% of the time? Asyncronous learning means that we are able to bend things to our schedule and give us more control over how we spend our time. We wouldn't have to wait for the rest of your classmates to finish doing an assignment in order to move onto the next lesson. It's perfect when we're at home, as parents are dumb and think they need to call in their child every two second. Yet, for some reason, we have this; forced video conferencing for about 6 hours of your day. I hope you guys have good devices, cause they would run out of power quickly.

We're in the 12th grade. We really don't need spoon-feeding. We could do things on our own, and we fully recognize that if we don't do something, we'd suffer the consequences. If we need help, we could very easily send over a video recording of what we need help with, or setup optional meetings, where students can tune in on their own, rather than forced seeings every day.

### Potential Solutions
Say we negated video conferencing altogether. That's great, but how would we get the material? There would need to be a way where the teacher does not have to be there in person-form but still deliver the content. However, that's still too vague and not really explicit on how to teach the material successfully to the student.

<ol>
<li><b>Take the in-person style and place it on a website with forced watching of pre-recorded clips</b><br>
In a real classroom, when you are tied to meeting in person, you must listen to what he has to say. However, in this digital world, you don't need to have any of those chains. *So why keep them?*
This is what a global platform titled Edgenuity tried to do. Over the course of the summer, I felt as if I was an absolute moron learning things I already knew. It made me really feel bad about myself. Is that what school is trying to be about? Making kids feel bad about themselves?</li>

<li><b>Remove teacher interaction altogether, just have the material grading and if they need extra resources, use someone else</b>
This seems to be a cleaner option, and in some ways, it is better than my proposed solution which I would list below. It allows students to explore resources, gaining experience with research. Heck, if there were a way to fact check everything on the internet and remove wrong content, this would be my proposed solution. However, the internet is a vast world, filled with many content creators. Unfortunately for teachers, it means that kids would learn that 1+1=3 because Mickey Mouse said so on le funny Youtube video

"Why not have a general platform specifically for educational videos with fact checkers"<br>
There's no proper way to monitize this in a way that suits everyone.

### Recommended Solution

- While we need to be able to talk to a supervisor if we need help, we should not be forced to talk to them through video conferencing
- We shouldn't be locked down to getting taught just by the course instructor. We have a world filled with resources out there.
- We need someone that would check our work manually instead of automatic grading. Automated systems have failed

This are a list of what you need to take into account when creating a solution for a huge issue like this. I think I've found one: What if we were to just have a list of assignments that we need to complete, with a pre-recorded video attachment that you could optionally watch if you need it? For human-teacher interaction, the students could reach out to the teacher via email if they need assistance to schedule an appointment and teachers could request of students to make an appointment when they need to talk about grade. Of course, the former is the student-volunteer which means the first issue is solved. The second issue is solved because we could always skip over the attechment.
