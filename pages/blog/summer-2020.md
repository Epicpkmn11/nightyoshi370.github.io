Summer is mostly a time students look forward to, due to the break from school for two months. It is a time where kids can play more video games, sleep later and have more time to hang out with friends. Unfortunately, I do not have the same viewpoint as them. I got tired of playing video games earlier this year, I sleep at the same time I normally sleep and I have even less time to hang out with friends. Most of my friends live far from where I am, so combined with my social awkwardness makes me extremely unlikely to hang out with them. That combined with the *current world events which I will refrain from mentioning due to everyone being sick of it* should have made my summer quite boring, but I found it to be the exact opposite. While I didn't end up working for anything this year, I still had a heck of an enjoyable time and I feel like I managed to make the best out of the situation I was facing.

This will be the story of how I made the best out of my 6 month long summer, with all the positives and the negatives that happened during this time frame.

### Part 1 -- NightScript vs Portfolio
When it was announced that schools would be taking a 2 week-long break, it was around the time where the original dsi.cfw.guide site owner returned and started to edit the website herself. It made me realize how much having a proper identity for myself was important, especially considering that colleges would be looking into me the following year. The first week of quarantine was a great time to start building up my reputation as a website maintainer and developer. I needed a portfolio website.

My original portfolio design was a clone of the Discord client's User Interface, built on extremely outdated standards. After getting reintroduced to Bootstrap, I started to completely redo my website from the ground up, using my sketches from class as a base. It was quite an adventure, but it is [already documented](/projects/ns-domain) so check that page.

That one week was a nice escape from reality, but I had to jump back into it, making for the second part of this extended summer vacation

### Part 2 -- NightScript vs College Board

Getting back into school after a full week of coding was an interesting process. After we shut down back in the week of March 10th, our school handled online school as a barren wasteland. Instead of actively giving us lessons, I went an entire month without doing anything in terms of schooling and the month after that was filled with somewhat-productive schooling from 2 teachers (out of the 6 I had). The rest either did not give assignments or mismanaged them. I didn't care about them though, as I had my AP exams to handle.

Since we couldn't do these exams in person, College Board decided to have this exam handled online by having the WORST management College Board has ever done.

- College Board made the entire world take these AP exams on a US-based timezone, which meant that people in countries other than the US would take these exams at times where they should be sleeping or studying. It's kind of ironic when all these "AP Exams tips" give you basic human tips and not tips on the exam itself, yet you can't even follow those tips
- College Board did not properly test their software, meaning at least 10K students couldn't submit their work. It got so bad that they ended up making email submissions an official way to submit answers.
- The score you got on your AP exam relied on either one or two free-response questions, with a 45 minute time limit. Whatever you learned during your entire year didn't matter anymore; if you don't know the answer to this one question, you're screwed

The best I made out of this situation was that I managed to score a 3 on my AP US History exam. I am proud of myself for being able to do that. I didn't score so lucky on the other tests.

Still, there was true school I had to do as well, and this is how *that* was handled:

### Part 3 -- NightScript vs mis-quarantine school

Out of my 6 teachers, 2 of them decided to have mandatory zoom classes as opposed to giving us assignments and us completing them on our own (with optional Zoom office hours). These Zoom Classes were held on Monday Afternoon, Wednesday Morning, Wednesday Afternoon and Friday Morning.

- The class I took on Monday and Wednesday afternoons was my Intro to Data Science class, in which our dumb teacher just told us to go to a website and do math problems there. We also did our regular R programming language learning, but I didn't do them because I was so invested into Project Plus (smash bros brawl mod) and I know the language better than the teacher himself. The class I remember best happened on April 1st, and the only reason why I remember was because students were anti-semetic, calling jews "penny pinchers".
- The class I took on Wednesday and Friday mornings were my AP Biology class, in which my teacher did not know what to do. None of the material she gave would end up on the AP exam, none of her students showed up to her zoom meetings and typically, I'd be focusing on my blue stress ball. I got a ton of credit for showing up to the class though, so I got from a B to an A in the class.

The other 4 teachers were normal in the terms that they were willing to not force zoom meetings on us but did not communicate with us properly

- My Graphic Design teacher started off with JavaScript canvases, which I used to create Yamamura's image commands. I did not need to relearn this, so I got everything done in 5 minutes. The second half was vector graphics, something I will never be able to do due to being very dumb.
Due to all the extra credit I did in the year, I passed this class with the highest grade she's ever given out; 112%
- My AP US History teacher has always been extremely understanding, but this quarantine made me appreciate him a lot more. I did most of the work I could, always trying to get more done. Still, I couldn't do everything but it was in his class that I got a 3 on the AP exam so congrats to him
- My Ethnic Studies class was non existant. We had ONE assignment, and I got away with it because I was in 3 AP classes. There's not much to say on here.
- I never thought my English class experience could get any worse at this point, but my AP English Language teacher set a new low. We had to do three revisions of the same assignment across an entire 3 months (the last revision being considered our final) and she made no effort to reach out or explain to us how to do this assignment. The assignment simply said write about a medical ethic, and after picking Animal Cloning and writing 2 pages on it, I got a straight up zero. Turns out I had to treat this as if I were writing a book, with a minimum of 10 pages, a cover page and an ending page, plus adherense to both the MLA and traditional essay format (intro, middle and end). No matter how much I tried, I could not stretch out Animal Cloning to 10 pages, even with help from an IB student from Ontario. I ended up getting a 70% on this assignment, despite the ridiculous requirements<br>Wanna know how I found out the requirements? She posted them a week after the final was due and the last week of school, during my AP Bio retake season.

There is no good to be taken out of that English class, but I am very grateful that my other classes were smooth sailing for the most part.

### Part 4 -- NightScript vs Summer School

Remember when I said that the AP English Language class was the worst English class I've ever had? If this teacher wasn't so generous, it would have been topped.

English 10A was another bad English class I've been through, and I needed to make that up because I got a D in that class (I got a D in AP English Language too, but this pandemic is to blame). Unfortunately, money got in the way and as part of a business deal, a service called Edgenuity was used. Though, I'm kind of sick and tired of beating around the dead horse, so [have a link instead]()
What I didn't describe in that rant though, was the results of writing that. I proceeded with my initial goal of sending it to the school principal and to my teacher, only to be rejected at first. Luckily for me though, the WiFi at my house became so bad the website did not want to load. Despite GMail and my personal blog loading, Edgenuity did not want to load. It gotten so bad that I had to switch out my entire chromebook but by the time that happened, summer school was almost over. Rather than blame things on me though, my teacher went ahead and gave me an A in the class, effectively meaning that my 6 hours of writing that rant was not wasted on nothing.

I am very grateful that my teacher is able to understand my frustrations with systems like those and is willing to provide alternatives.

### Part 5 --- NightScript vs New York
I planned to have this as its own blog but to be honest, my New York experience was not that interesting to have a dedicated page.

First off, I hope I never go to the airport that I flew with ever again due to their constant rudeness. "Your luggage is three pounds overweight, give me one hundred dollars". Who the heck do you think you are?

- The software on the airplane tablet was quite interesting on the way there, being effectively Android but with a custom launcher and preinstalled games (such as Sudoku). My mistake was thinking it'd be the same software on the way back, when I already put Sudoku on my Luggage as opposed to my carry on.
- We came to the airport way too early though, and were waiting there for an hour and thirty minutes on top of the six hour flight. Next time I do anything of this sort, I'm planning time better.
- The spotlight of this trip was to go see my sister for her wedding. Sure, it could have been much nicer if the *current world events* weren't a thing but it was still enjoyable enough to the point where I don't care what it could have been. The only things I specifically remember disliking from it was the constant requests to remove my mask, the way the food was offered, the rap music being played and my phone battery almost running out.

I am grateful that I was able to experience such a thing in my family.

### Part 6 --- NightScript vs TWiLight Menu++

I've also started to want to contribute to other projects as well. While I have started a dsi.cfw.guide rewrite (but I am not writing about that because Evie and urmum redid my redo), getting a position on Universal Team as advertiser and general manager, did research on the nesDS emulator and countless other small projects of mine (which I should get back to), my most notable contributions was the ones made to TWiLight Menu++, the alternative menu for the Nintendo DS-line of handhelds. It's much easier for developers to now add new manual pages, new homebrew emulators to launch, new flashcarts for autobooting support and so much more. I've even started working on a HTML => .BMP renderer for the manual pages, but I didn't have enough time to properly research completing that.

I am very grateful for RocketRobz for accepting my contributions to his application, and the people that helped test my constant failures.

### Conclusion

So, the true reason why I'm writing this is because of an assignment my teacher gave us, that we have to write at least 5 good things that happened to us during the summer. I will keep the name of this teacher private but in case the teacher is the one reading this, feel free to confirm that I am the student submitting this by emailing me over at maorninja@outlook.com, typing the name of who you are and the student that is submitting this.

This was truly a summer that I will never forget. As I go back into reality, I wonder if I will get a chance like this again. So many things were done in just a short time span and who knows what will come out of the series of events that took place this summer.
