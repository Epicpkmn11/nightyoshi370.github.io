So with the Mania's success and Forces's failure, it is no doubt about it that SEGA would be looking to appealing the classic fans. However, a simple rehash of the old games wouldn't work a third time. At a certain point, people will become sick of it and want something original. Besides, there's still a lot of potential in the Phantom Ruby and Infinite too, so it'd be cool if we could continue the saga.

### Story
The phantom ruby, while the physical object itself is the same, actually serves different purposes from Mania and Forces. To explain the story, when Classic Sonic defeated the Phantom King, the ruby got teleported to Forces. Eggman was researching it and created prototypes until he made an exact clone, which he instilled into infinite. The true Phantom Ruby was destroyed by Classic Sonic, Modern Sonic and the avatar. The true phantom ruby can warp space and time, transporting you to places of old. The Phantom Ruby that infinite has is dependent on an energy source and can corrupt the current area. A great example of this is Stage 16 of Sonic Forces, where Infinite creates giant versions of himself throughout the stage, flips gravity, etc. Since we're bringing back infinite, we have to bring back his Ruby and not Mania's.

This game will also retcon Sonic Mania Plus; Classic Sonic's world shouldn't be defined by JUST mania. I guess if you wanted to keep it canon, just say that Classic Sonic split into two after fighting the Phantom king, where one is now back where he started and one went into Forces's world. Either way, it'd make for a much more compeling plot and it'd be cooler to have a completely new game take place after Forces instead of a DLC pack to the former game, so away it goes.

After the events of Sonic Forces, we follow Classic Sonic being transported to the home of the Master Emerald; Angel Island. What he finds there, unfortunately, was the same villain he never faced (yet saw) in Sonic Forces; Infinite. After looking around, it seems as if the entire shrine of the Master Emerald has been destroyed (Lava Reef, the home of the Master Emerald is located in Angel Island). Tails and Knuckles are there too, but they all look warn out. Sonic takes one big spindash at infinite, but Infinite traps him in a red box. After sonic himself being warn out, all three of them are sent out to Null Space.

Yep, Null Space is our first level, not generic city or grass level. It seems much more original, plus it's an element we could do better than forces since it'd be a full level and not a 2 second straight line. The powerup of choice here would be the Fire Shield. Anywho, a Phantom Infinite would be our first boss fight, but it wouldn't be the 2nd infinite boss fight from forces. This infinite can't put a phantom in Null Space, so it'd be more of a 1 on 1 thing, similar to the Koopalings. Once you've defeated the rather easy boss fight, Null Space starts falling apart so Act 3 would be a ~~jojo reference~~ fast-pace level, where you have to quickly run to jump from platform to platform to get out of there.

When you exit, you've ended up in a sub-urban place where all of the place now became a metropolis. Not the one from Sonic 2; The one from Forces. You look up and see weird UFOs flying around. Running through the level, you find egg pawns scattered everywhere with zip lines, elevators and buildings to go across. The recommended powerup here is Lightning. Instead of having a boss over at Act 2 though, you'll see an eggman machine far in the background during Act 2. In the transition from Act 2 to 3, Eggman would come behind you and start chasing you across the level. At the end, you come face to face with him and metal sonic. Once they've been defeated, the heroes realize that they've been controlled by the ruby and help them out. Robotnik, finding Metal Sonic in a normal condition, sends him to join our heroes into a ghost house area.

This ghost house is filled with floating platforms, lanterns that act similar to the scale platform from Super Mario Maker 2, and has a light gimmick similar to Sandopolis act 2. However, unlike Sandopolis, the main color is dark blue (similar to Mario Ghost House) and isn't a momentum killer. Instead, turning on lights would act similar to checkpoint; run across it and it would activate. The main powerup here is the bubble shield, since it allows easy platform traversion for act 3 and is useful for when it gets flooded in act 2.

In Act 3, the ghost house starts collapsing. Unlike Null Space, this has more spacious platform and you don't end up escaping. You fall in a sandy area, where a boss fight with Fang the Snipper would take place. Amy would be unlocked once the boss is unlocked.

Exiting the sandy area brings you to a Castle. This is similar to the Ghost House, except there's Lava and the layout is structured. Lanterns are used again, but as decoration instead of a gimmick. Stage 2 would have an anti-gravity gimmick extremely similar to VVVVVV.

The boss here in Act 2 would probably be the Heavy King himself, and his gimmick would be to create lava waves. Beating him wouldn't revert the gimmick though, so its a mad dash through the upper and lower stage to get out of the castle

Clearing this stage would bring you to a Jungle Beach hybrid level. This stage has you swinging on vines, going through the arctic ocean and running on water while fish try to drag you down. Before Act 1, you unlock Mighty and Ray. Act 2's gimmick is stolen from Super Mario Maker 2 Forest Night. The water you were swimming in has turned into poison and the fish dragging you down leads to instant death.<br>
The boss here would be a giant squid spitting a bunch of fish.<br>
Between Act 2 and 3, there would be a little cutscene of Infinite coming from above (yeah, we haven't seen him all game) and making phantom monkeys that chase you as you swing from vine to vine. You end up escaping on the tornado that picks you up as your running on the poisonous water.

Yep, Sky Chase Zone makes a return, everyone's favorite stage. Not gonna need to explain anything here. Only difference is that it's heading towards Angel Island area instead of Eggman's ship. No need for a boss either in this stage, since it's mostly filler. At this point, infinite attacks the tornado and they crash land into Ice Cap zone.

Ice Cap Zone starts off with you in a pile of snow. The main gimmick here is the ice that you slip on and the constant icicles.<br>
Act 2 has a lava explosion which transforms the Ice Cap into a freezeflame (which would make WillyMaker happy). The main gimmick here is the lava fall. Boss here is a phantom Eggman again in the Death Egg Robot.<br>
Act 3, has a snow-board section, just like the beginning of Act 1 of Sonic 3 Ice Cap Zone in Sonic's playthrough. The repaired tornado catches you and flies off to Sky Sanctuary

Sky Sanctuary is the final zone of the game. As mentioned above, it's more like a ancient rome rural area. Over in the backgrounds, you could see infinite statues, and wanted pictures for Eggman (yes, eggman. Not Robotnik). This area would be filled with bottomless pits, and Act 1 would have zip lines.<br>
The final boss would be infinite, but I haven't decided how it would be.<br>
The secret final boss would be an super sonic boss fight against an enraged infinite taking place over a horizon sunset. I guess it would be something relating to Sonic 3 & Knuckles & Sonic Neo Geo Pocket.

### Characters
This game will have 7 playable characters, two more from Sonic Mania Plus. You'll start off with your traditional 3 but earn more as you progress in the game.
- Sonic would have the drop dash.
- Tails would have the power of flight.
- Knuckles would have a glide and the ability to climb up walls.
- Metal Sonic has a homing attack.
- Amy Rose would have a moveset similar to the one she had in Sonic Advance.
- Mighty would have the ground pound.
- Ray would have the cape mechanic from SMW, like he did in Sonic Mania Plus.

Each would have their own individual routes they would be able to take, similar to Sonic 3 & Knuckles.

### Structure
As we can see, it would be a 7 zone'd game with 3 acts each. The first act would be the main theme, the second act would be a remix and the third act would be a autorunner stage, similar to the Mock Speed sections from 06.

Instead of having multiple campaigns, you'd be able to select your character before every zone. I don't see the need to have the character per save file. Of course, once you have a character, you stick to that character for that zone. No switching in-between.

In Sonic Adventure, you have treasure hunting, racing, fishing, shooting, etc..not really consistent. I plan to go the Sonic 3 & Knuckles style, where they have the same gameplay except they each have their own routes.

### Bonus Games
Honestly, having blue spheres as the bonus games itself was quite lame. It didn't really benefit the campaign itself.<br>
Instead, bonus games would be a combination of Sonic 3 & Knuckles's and the Encore Mode of Sonic Mania Plus.<br>
Those benefit the main game, giving you items, rings and others...


### Special Stage
In classic sonic games, the special stages are a bit too different than the main game.
- In sonic 1, you were curled up into a ball and had to go through many different prisms to get the chaos emerald
- In sonic 3D Blast (Saturn), Sonic 2, Sonic Heroes, Sonic 4: Episode 2, Sonic Colors DS & Sonic Generations 3DS, you had to go through a half pipe to attempt to dodge bombs (while hoping that Tails isn't annoying) and collect enough rings to advance through 3 sections. No, I'm not calling all of those games classic games. I'm trying to show how overused the half-pipe is.
- In Sonic 3 & Knuckles, you are on a circle trying to collect blue spheres.
- In Sonic Mania, they finally have a fully functional 3D engine for their special stages

Yeah, in case you couldn't tell, I'm saying it stray's away way too much. In my opinion, Special Stages should be, you know, Special Stages and not Special Mini-Games.

Instead, it would be much more fun if it were an extension of the current game structure. Maybe a race between you and Infinite to get the chaos emerald first while traversing a gauntlet of platforms?


### Presentation
Art style plays a key role on how a game should be played out. However, does it really need a change from Mania? If you think about it, the 32x style is the best art style a true Classic Sonic game has ever seen. Plus, we're supposed to be returning from Forces back to Mania's world, so why would we present it in a new way.

---

Overall, what I am trying to say is that a new Classic Sonic game could be original and still include a Phantom ruby while not being a cash grab, nostalgia panderer and a slap to the face for the series. Many people on Twitter hate Classic Sonic, but honestly, does it really matter? Sonic Team wants to make it so that 3D is Modern while 2D is Classic, and again; this is Infinite going into Classic's world and a sequel to Forces. All we know, is that it'd be the sequel Forces wishes it could be.
