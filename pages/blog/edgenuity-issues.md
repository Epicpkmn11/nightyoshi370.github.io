# Edgenuity Issues
<small class="font-italic font-weight-light font-underline">Published on July 6th, 2020 - Edited on July 7th, 2020</small>

Back in my 10th grade, I had an English teacher that did not know how to teach. He was so bad I wrote a 10 page essay on why he’s so bad and the year I left the private school, he was not asked to return or got fired. However, during the first semester, I’ve gotten a D and I know I could do better than a D. I’ve had so much experience writing blog articles and so much more I feel like I can do anything related. However, as reality has it for me, this English class was another bust, and it isn’t the teacher’s fault.

According to the research I’ve done, a company titled Edgenuity has been going around telling school districts that the teachers cannot teach and that their system is the best way. The Los Angeles Unified School District bought into this mindset and has started making schools use it for their summer school. Normally, I prefer online learning, but this is a downgraded version of the outdated school teaching mindset that I will describe later on in the essay. It has gotten so bad that after heavy discussion between users on my Discord server and Teachers, I’ve decided to make this blog article to explain everything that I dislike about Edgenuity, why it should NOT be used and why I’ll be dropping out of my summer school.

1. When I try to access Edgenuity on my chromebook, I get a HTTP 401 error meaning I cannot access the page. This means I'm forced to use my primary laptop for Edgenuity which means I cannot share my screen with my teacher. I do my Zoom calls with my teacher on my chromebook due to needing both a camera and a microphone.
2. Whenever I try to minimize the tab so I can go on another tab to take notes, the video pauses. My friend, Kalam, gave me the suggestion of using a Virtual Machine and while that's a great suggestion, I should not have to deal with that in the first place.
3. The video player does not support subtitles; only video. Any important information I would have to grab would have to be paused and replayed. I read faster than I listen, due to constantly watching Japanese animation with subtitles instead of dubbed anime.

   Even having subtitles be automatically generated would be better than none at all.
4. The video speed is too slow, and while that is supposed to make it more open towards others who can’t comprehend fast hearing, it limits the people who cannot comprehend slow hearing. Of course, if the video player feature on the site had features from mainstream video players, I would be able to speed up the audio. I wouldn’t even mind it playing at a higher pitch; I listen to japanese music at 1.29x its original pitch.

   However, Edgenuity has not implemented a feature to fast forward or slow down the video. It’s irritating, to say the least, when I already know the material. I’m only here to raise my grade from a D that I got. It’s not like I’m failing.

   Granted, some of my friends speak slowly, so why can I tolerate them while I cannot tolerate the "teachers" (note the quotation marks) at Edgenuity? Because…
5. I cannot engage with the teachers at Edgenuity. I cannot ask questions, I cannot have communications. It's important to have that in the "classic course" routine. Granted, if Summer School were handled as it was back in March - June 2020 of the school year, we wouldn't need to have direct teaching since there would be optional zoom sessions for class explanations, assignments and lessons optionally attached to said assignments. There wouldn't be the classic "one on one" system that we expect out of the standard classroom environment.

   You might be asking, why are you complaining now yet you were fine with it back when school was functioning normally? To tell you the truth, I've always had an issue with this outdated method, however it mostly boiled down to personal preference and I know multiple people that liked learning this way. However, Edgenuity tries to replicate said system while removing the things about it that worked and the reasons people liked it. People like the interactivity they had between teachers and students, but you cannot communicate with these robots.
6. The material taught in Edgenuity, while attempting to be educational, ends up being harmful to students. To quote one lesson, "Don't try to be something or someone that you're not". Excuse me, so are we all supposed to be teachers right when we're born? Being something that you're not is literally how programmers are born. Kids shouldn't enjoy LEGO anymore since they're not builders. I guess no one can ever have a job, since you can never try to be something. You see how harmful these lessons are?

   You might be thinking that I’m looking too deep into things, and if so, let’s look at things with face value (aka what is being presented instead of trying to interpret things on our own)

   The course aims are to improve all aspects of the English that we speak, as in Writing, Reading and Communicating. If that's the case, how do we have work such as the following?
   > He took the Elephant - All-the-Elephant-there-was - and said 'Play at being an Elephant,' and All-the-Elephant-there-was played. He took the Beaver - All-the-Beaver-there-was - and said 'Play at being a Beaver,' and All-the-Beaver-there-was played. He took the Cow - All-the-Cow-there-was - and said 'Play at being a Cow,' and All-the-Cow-there-was played.

   The aim of this was trying to show how to determine who the target audience for a passage is. In this example, it is clearly oriented towards children, by repeating words. However, isn’t this course supposed to be oriented towards improving communication in real life? How could we then include farm examples here? It doesn’t make any sense.

   I’ve also had an issue where they try to get into my personal life. In a certain assignment, it asked me what creates images in my mind, and then it told me what they think should be in my mind. Even though all of these sentences make images in my mind, they determined it was wrong.

   I was wondering if anyone else had any issues with Edgenuity so I checked the Edgenuity fan subreddit and look what...interesting...things I found:

   - [Sexist Ideologies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edgenuity/comments/hczarj/what_why_did_Edgenuity_approve_of_this_in_the/)
   - [Incorrect information about largest desert](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edgenuity/comments/h7ce2n/quick_google_search_proved_that_the_largest/)

   It’s not just me that has issues with this site
7. Their absolute insistence that you learn it from them is extremely harmful. In order to advance to the course assignment, we have to watch their video fully without skipping around or doing anything of the sort. You are to sit for the next 4 minutes with the tab highlighted (point 2), and no speed up (point 4). As well as being inaccurate (point 6), there are other better courses and works students can engage in that offer more face value than what is being presented. For example, I do my own independent writing on a blog. Here are two examples of my writing.

   - [Issues with ownership](https://nightyoshi370.github.io/blog/ownership-issues)
   - [Video game development plan](https://nightyoshi370.github.io/blog/sonic-return-of-infinite)

   Heck, even the ones I’m not proud of (such as [this one about gaming](https://nightyoshi370.github.io/blog/gaming)) still offer me experience, practices, and allow me to analyze the way I write. I already know on my own what words such as “analyze” and “theme” is; why do I need a computer to force me to watch it?

   Plus, the definition of said words isn’t the greatest, but if little Jimmy wanted to use another resource, it isn’t one or the other. We can’t skip the video and say “we already learned this”.

   Your counterclaim might be “well, shouldn’t they first try out learning it from Edgenuity and then seeing if they need additional resources?”. Yeah, that’s a valid thought for the first few lessons, but the expectations for Edgenuity were already low. They force users to learn how to “properly” navigate their website by shoving in two 10-minute tutorials the minute you first join their website. The tutorial, in reality, was just common sense and could have been figured out by just looking at the website. They should have made the first time guide optional but just like the lessons, they’re the ones who decide what we may digest and what we may not.

   First impressions are extremely important. For example, in the video game world, they determine whether a console would be successful or not. New Super Mario Bros U was the Nintendo Wii U’s first impression and that’s why it was a failure. Meanwhile, Breath of the Wild was the Nintendo Switch’s first impression and it’s easily the best Nintendo console ever released. So, looking at Edgenuity, you could already see why people don’t like forced tutorials when they point out the obvious.
8. The amount of work served is overwhelming, especially to those who prefer to take their time, either to improve quality or require assistance understanding the material. As someone that does not like strict time limits, I feel emotionally destroyed when I miss one day and I see 2 hours of work. This past week, I have 8 hours of work missing and my mental level is going down the drain.

   Looking through the subreddit I mentioned before, I found this image:
   > ![](https://preview.redd.it/9pqi6nchrs351.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=32556fd4dff356a16b8e34c2331470985d74d6c1)     
   > <footer><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Edgenuity/comments/gze79c/this_is_going_to_be_hell/">Source (Reddit)</a></footer>

   This is WRONG. They shove thousands of assignments down people's throats and you can’t speed it up to try and catch up because of the previous points (can’t fast forward and force to watch the video and it has to be from them).
9. The fact that you're limited to **one** session is difficult for those on multiple computers. What if you have to transition between devices? Why do I have to relogin? Are you scared of cheaters?
   You see how this adds to the whole control freak issue I wrote about in point 7?
10. Now, about the class itself, I don’t even feel like I need it. The method that is used to do the course is more troublesome than it’s worth, and I’m only doing this because I need to make up a D from my 10th grade English class. If I have to deal with all this emotional stress though, I don’t want to do this.

To get to the point, I feel like Edgenuity is a terrible platform and easily is the worst offender of the mindset that school districts choose what is cheap rather than what has the most value in learning. Edgenuity attempts to make learning easier for both teachers and students by using the familiar system we all know and love, yet removes key elements from it. If I can easily write 6 pages on how bad this platform is yet I've only been in it for a week, how much moreso will I write once I've been there for much longer. There are even aspects that I haven't gotten into, such as [serious bugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edgenuity/comments/hifm75/i_i_didnt_even_write_anything_and_got_a_100/) that could potentially make the front page of r/softwaregore, the subreddit for showcasing how glitchy computer software can get. Yet, I don't want to stay for much longer, and that's why I'm writing this.

To the principal of the summer school, if you are reading this, I want you to be able to understand my point of view. I'm someone who has written articles after articles on this very website, a documentation that some claimed was over-done and an entire 10 page essay I wrote on why the 10th grade teacher I had was an awful teacher (turns out I was right because he did not return the following year). I just want to bring up a D I have received because I know that I fully comprehend the material given to me. However, I do not need any spoonfeeding of any kind, and I'd rather get the assignments directly from the teacher. After all, if the teacher isn't there to teach, then what's her job? Why not rename them to "helpers" and let the robotic humans over at Edgenuity do their job?

However, I feel for the students that have to deal with this system. According to a recent survey, I am not the only one with issues against Edgenuity. I don't think it's fair that school districts can bully schools into using broken systems. That's why I'm writing this to you; not just to stop me from using it, but for all those that cannot deal with it anymore. It's time we took a stand against this toddlers tool and revert back to the old teaching ways of Zoom calling classrooms. No more forced video watching! No more robots detailing how you should think or not! No more bugs, glitches, awful bloated lessons and emotional stress! We need the old system; the system that we would use in college and the rest of our lives! I'm not a fan of it, but it's certainly better than whatever we got over here.

To summarize my requests:

1. Drop me out of English 10A 2020.
2. Forward this link to the Los Angeles Unified School District and express the reasons why we need a change of systems.

Together we could do this! It's certainly hypocritical of me to be working this much for a rant yet I wouldn't use this time to do the actual work in Edgenuity, but that's the thing; we don't need Edgenuity. We have our own high school minds, ones that are able to think for ourselves and use what we enjoy. Everyone has creative skill and it just needs a little push to let it all out. Edgenuity, does not provide this.

I hope to hear from you soon. I respectfully that LAUSD reconsider its use of the Edgenuity platform, or that teachers be allowed to modify curriculum to suit the needs of their students.
