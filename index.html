				<h1 class="mb-1">Welcome to the NightScript Domain</h1>
				<p>This website was made to document things I've accomplished over the years. Maybe you'll find something interesting here?</p>
				<p>As for who I am; well, I'm kind of a lazy 16 year old programmer that is extremely enthusiastic in open source code and external contributions. I mainly program for the homebrew community, specifically the Nintendo DS Homebrew community.<br>
				I also find interest in graphic design (using Photoshop CS6), writting, gaming and moderating. I am a moderator for Mario Making Mods (a discord server on modding the Super Mario Maker series) and the DS(i) Mode Hacking Discord Server.</p>
				<p>I do most of my communications on Discord (primarily on my personal Discord Server) but I'm also reachable elsewhere. Just take a look at my social page to know where to find me. I also take PayPal donations, if that's sort of your thing.</p>
				<h3 class="mb-1">Gaming</h3>
				<p>My favorite video game series are probably Super Smash Bros. & the Classic Sonic Series. More importantly, I love the momentum based gameplay, since it really takes advantage of the games physics. Despite not having that many collectables (other than the 7 chaos emeralds and rings), it still manages to become replayable by rewarding speed in the platforming. For example, I always revisit Green Hill Zone to try and beat my previous record.<br>
				As for Smash Bros, I mainly play Project Plus, a fan-made mod of Brawl made to replicate Melee. The character I play differentiates between each game. For example, I'm a K Rool, Meta Knight & Mario main in Smash Ultimate while simultaneously being a Wario, Mario & Ness main in Project Plus. What I love about Smash Bros is how it takes all these iconic characters (and the characters from the Fire Emblem series) and puts them against eachother in a Nintendo-esque way. Rather than having health bars and bordered walls, it takes a much more casual approach. Even though I think they took that approach too far in Brawl (hence why I don't play it), it's a much more inviting game than making your own characters.</p>
