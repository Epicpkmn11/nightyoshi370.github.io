			<h1 class="mb-1">Welcome to the NightScript Domain!</h1>
			<p>This website was made to record various accomplishments I've done over the years. The content you may find here could range from video game reviews, blogs, projects or other things I may throw onto here. Maybe you'll find something interesting here? Who knows, but hey; at least appreciate the nice beautiful background of a mountain. Well, for those of you who weren't distracted and did not go to the source code of this website to see the image in its full glory, note that this website is open source on GitHub. Heck, this website is hosted on GitHub using GitHub Pages. I guess that should tell you what type of person I am.</p>
			<p>If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm kind of a laid-back yet lazy 16 year old programmer that is extremely enthusiastic in open source code and external contributions. I mainly program for the homebrew community, specifically the Nintendo DS Homebrew community. I can code in PHP, JavaScript, Python and some C++.<br>
			Programming isn't the only thing I do (but it's my specialty). I also find interest in graphic design (using Photoshop CS6), writing, gaming and moderating. Outside of my own personal server, I moderate Mario Making Mods (a discord server on modding the Super Mario Maker series) and the DS(i) Mode Hacking Discord Server. It's rare that you'll see me moderate though, because most of the userbase are rule-abiding users.</p>
			<p>I do most of my communications on Discord (primarily on my personal Discord Server) but I'm also reachable elsewhere. Just take a look at my social page to know where to find me. I go by three names: maorninja(322), NightYoshi370 and NightScript. I much prefer NightScript but some sites either have it taken or don't allow name changes.<br>
				I also take PayPal donations, if that's sort of your thing.</p>
			<h3 class="mb-1">Gaming</h3>
			<p>When I have the time to play video games, I'd much prefer to play them on my laptop. It is the most versatile option available to playing games from different platform. The Lenovo Yoga 710, while objectively underpowered for complex gaming, can run applications like CEMU (a Nintendo Wii U emulator) quite well so it works for me. However, I have an Old Blue 3DS XL, a Purple DS Lite with a broken SLOT-1 loader (so I never use it except for DS Download Play) and a Nintendo Wii (which I never use but my step-brothers seem to adore). My step-brother lent me his Nintendo Switch but we don't have it anymore. So yeah, I'm quite the Nintendo fan. Actually, that would be incorrect; I'm more of a fan of old-school traditional game series. I don't like the hallway style of modern 3D games or the "shoot everything" design in the shooter games. I am, however, a fan of learning the games inside out to take advantage of any pro-level mechanic, like wave-dashing in Smash Bros (despite me unable to do so in Project Plus), or gaining momentum in the Classic-era Sonic games. Oh yeah, those series...</p>
			<p>...are my favorite video game series of all time. My favorite entry in the Super Smash Bros. series is a Brawl mod called Project Plus. It combines melee's gameplay and mentality to make an extremely competitive game, with returning features such as wave-dashing and brawl's newcomers getting melee redesigns. It even adds more bonuses such as Knuckles, splitting the Pok√©mon trainer into three different character slots, brings back melee characters and has 3 alternative versions for every stage. It's the most content heavy Smash Bros game in the entire series, even surpassing official games like Super Smash Bros Ultimate. The character I play differentiates between each game.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, I mainly play as King K Rool, Meta Knight & Mario.</li>
				<li>In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for the forgotten Nintendo console that got superseded by the switch, I mainly play as Bayonetta, Lucas, Sonic & Mario.</li>
				<li>In Project Plus, I mainly play as Ness but I can go to Wario and Mario too. Sonic can be considered at times, but he's not as fun as his Smash 4 counterpart.</li>
				<li>In Super Smash Flash 2, I play as Meta Knight and Sonic. Mario too, but he's not as fun as his Smash 4 counterpart.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Those are the four Smash Bros games I look back too. Smash 64 doesn't have enough content and everything good about Brawl and Melee is merged into Project Plus. Each and every one of these games have something to make it different.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Want the latest official Smash game with every character from every official smash game? Go with Ultimate</li>
				<li>Want to play Smash Run, a fun side-game where you collect stats for four minutes until you go into a big battle with everyone else? Go to Smash 3DS.</li>
				<li>Want to have a fun story mode with all your favorite Nintendo characters? Brawl is the game for you (but play Project Plus so it doesn't feel slow paced).</li>
				<li>Want to play extremely competitively with a bunch of extremely advanced techniques, yet an awful roster due to clone characters? Melee is the game for you (Project Plus has that but with more content).</li>
				<li>Don't care about what's going on in school and just want to play Smash Bros? Super Smash Flash 2 is the game to play.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>What I love about Smash Bros is how it takes iconic characters (and the 8 Marths that Nintendo just loves so much) and puts them against eachother in a Nintendo-esque way. Rather than having health bars and bordered walls, it takes a much more casual approach. Even though I think they took the casual market too far in regular Brawl, it's a much more inviting game than standard fighting games.</p>
			<p>In the Classic 2D Sonic games, the more you memorize the level, the better you know the fastest way to go through an act. The goal is to get the fastest times in an act, and that concept is the only type of replayability I ever need. Green Hill Zone, despite being hated on for its constant return in Modern Sonic games, is a perfect example of this design philosophy. There is no need to hunt down collectable by searching every pipe or randomly crouching through hidden walls. Now, that might make me seem like I hate other 2D platformer series, but that couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
			<p>Kirby is a series intended for easier players with design philosophies such as infinite flight and the relatively slow gameplay. Here's an example of the slow gameplay kirby has to offer: Rather than curling up into a super fast blue ball or timing your jump to hit their heads, kirby defeats his enemies by coming to a complete stand-still and sucking them up. The games compliment this new-player philosophy with collectables, and it makes sense for a series this laid back. For example, The Great Cave Offensive sub-game in Kirby Super Star Ultra (and the original respectively) does everything to complement the Kirby nature despite its name and Smash Bros stage representation doing anything but. While not a requirement, there are 60 collectables scattered throughout your journey to travel out of the cave. With Kirby, this type of system works phenomunously as it opens the gates to all players. If you're a new person just getting into video games, it's quite straight forward and easy to play through. However, it's copycat mario doesn't really have that much of a good time.</p>
