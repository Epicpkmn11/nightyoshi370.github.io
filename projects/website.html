			<h1 class="mb-1">The NightScript Domain!</h1>
			<p>This website was made to record various accomplishments I've done over the years. The content you may find here could range from video game reviews, blogs, projects or other things I may throw onto here. It is open source on GitHub and hosted using GitHub pages. It also features a really nice background stolen from macOS. Yeah, there's a reason why the design is like this, and let's start with your typical history lesson.</p>
			<h3>History of the Website Design</h3>
			<p>This website started because I wanted to have a place where I can show my projects to colleges. I wanted to also have a documentation of what I've done over the years. That's why it exists.</p>
			<p>Now, how this website actually came into fruition? Well, at first, the website layout was made for a 1-1 discord clone. Over time, I got tired of developing for it so I told the owner of the project that I quit. I didn't agree with their work practices, and I had other things to do (which I canceled too, funily enough). All the HTML couldn't have gone to waste though, so I wanted to use it for a portfolio website.</p>
			<p>I opened up my GitHub repository (as I said on the home page, I am a huge advocate of open source) and started getting to work. I commented out the Discord-specific contents (like images, messages and others) and changed the colors to match the Materialistic-Discord theme. Regardless of any work that I've done, there was still a ton of unused CSS which hogged up how I worked with it.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, CSS wasn't the only thing hogging it. I developed this in the Summer of 2017, before I knew of Bootstrap. Back in that time, I was using tables as the layout due to working with Blargboard and Acmlmboard software in general. It was highly discouraged and outdated since 2001 according to The Programmer's Hangout Discord Server. There were also other issues, such as mobile support and the layout rendering incorrectly. It was incredibly zoomed out and I couldn't add a toggle-able sidebar. It was also hard to develop for the actual page contents, so I only did one page.</p>
			<p>It has been a while since I have done website development, so I was unaware of what to do. Evie then re-introduced me to Bootstrap, which is different from what I used on MakerBoard. I've only worked with MDBootstrap, which requires jQuery and had a "PRO" model (which I pirated). I'm not a fan of paying for CSS work, so I've been turned off by the PRO model of MDBootstrap. I've decided to restart the website entirely, now developing with a Mobile-First ideology and using regular Bootstrap 4. I finally had the time to do so too, since I was stuck home due to COVID-19.</p>
			<h4>Rewrite of the website</h5>
			<p>The first thing I wanted to introduce with this rewrite was have a sidebar similar to what I've drawn in my notebook in school while not caring what the teacher is saying. A large icon with my avatar in a circle with the name "NightScript Domain" on the bottom was exactly what I had in mind, and I was looking online for the nicest looking one. The closest I found was this example by Catriona Henderson and.....it looked quite ugly and wasn't my type. Plus, the CSS was bloated and it used jQuery. However, it did what I was looking for so I decided to start mass editing the template. At the end, I've made it match the green asthetic that Javier gave me for my JavaScript avatar. The original page had the old-Discord light theme design; a gray sidebar with pure white text. That's not what I wanted, so I used yet again Materialistic Discord colors. It turned out nice, but I was getting tired of Materialistic-Discord. It was a step up from original Discord, but now I wasn't confined to discord asthetic. I should be able to take whatever asthetic I want and plug it in. Thankfully, I started looking into BetterDiscord themes, and found Midnight UI.</p>
			<p>Midnight UI had exactly the asthetic I was so yearning to see. Tropical#8908 really knocked it out of the park with this macOS inspired theme. It was so good that I didn't even care that it was a macOS background; I just wanted to use its colors for my website. The CSS of the BetterDiscord theme was EXTREMELY confusing but I ended up finding the link to the background. After adjusting the sidebar and buttons to match the color scheme, the design felt right at home. I didn't end up stealing actual code though, since I wanted to keep the HTML clean. Also, context is important when designing websites. A discord chat room and a portfolio website are vastly different, so I had to be creative too. I ended up not having the gray background used on posts and instead just had the text directly on the background. Kaisaan and sks316 helped me pick a text color that didn't make people bleed their eyes out because of how bright it'd be. I feel like it worked in the long run, but there were two issue; mobile and Apple.</p>
			<p>The other part of the website I wanted to focus on this time was accessibility. I frequently ran tests on Google Lighthouse Audits to get a score on how the website is and would do whatever I could to try and have a higher score. I've had to add zooming by scaling on mobile because apparently, that's needed to get a higher score because "accessibility". I've decided that adding a "back-to-top" button was necessary for accessibility, but I wanted to have it implemented confortably. The actual link implementation worked out great and JavaScript isn't even mandatory (but it gives a better experience by not adding a number sign to the URL). Basically, I wanted the button to appear only after the user scrolled 20 pixels past the top of the screen. I couldn't do that via CSS so if the user has Javascript disabled, he would have to see the scroll back to top button at all times. There wasn't an easy way to have a "if no JS, show at all times" method, so now there's a 0.3 second pop-in. That's fine though, since it's short and lets the user know that the button exists when it's needed. The second issue was the arrow not working on mobile and Apple, again.</p>
			<p>Notice how I repeated mobile and apple? The first issue I had was with the background not appearing. It was just the solid color. Thankfully, Evie made me aware that <code>background-attachment: fixed</code> would not work on mobile and made a solution. Evie is also the one who fixed the button issue, suggesting that I use Font Awesome's up arrow instead. Both of her workarounds worked fine, I just needed to do things on my end. To fix the background error, I had to make a new div element that had a fixed position, and that would contain the background. I also needed to change the cover to the top, and that was quite...I dunno, I'd rather have it in the middle but life isn't perfect. I'd much rather having presentability on a mobile device than just a simple few pixels towards the top.</p>
			<p>The next thing I wanted to implement were share buttons for blog cards. Back when I did this for MakerBoard, I could do it from the backend, no problem. Here, I had no PHP backend; it was just a static website. I had to improvise a way. This is one of the few things I decided to force users to use Javascript for. Dynamically having the link would be much easier to maintain. How I ended up doing it was adding a noscript tag telling users that they needed to have Javascript in order to see share links, which ironically checking for that noscript tag in the JavaScript. It would then add onto the parent div the contents of an array containing information of the shared social media links.</p>
			<p>The last thing I implemented was a masking background. The original background had it where the corners would be the corners, but as you go in the center, the background started to appear. Due to CSS's confusing "standards", I wasn't sure what the property names were, and nothing appeared for me. Thankfully, Evie came to save the day again, and explained the property name and fixed the corners being white.</p>
			<h2>Credits</h2>
			<p>Who to give credits too is actually confusing for the most part. See, Tropical introduced me to the macOS background and created the general asthetic, but again; it's a macOS background; All she did was coloring. I didn't steal any of their HTML either, so I'm not really sure how to credit her. The original person who made me do the discord layout (and what got me to start developing this website) has no actual part on the website itself anymore and they deleted their discord account. Also, Catriona Henderson made the bloated code, but without her I wouldn't have been able to do this. See, this is why crediting is confusing when you don't have a pure diff of everythings that's different. Still, I know what Evie and I did and I definitely do have to give credit for things I know happened.<ul>
				<li>NightScript: Creator of this website, made all the web pages (unless specified otherwise), implemented back-to-top & social buttons, converted Catriona Henderson's work to a non-jQuery environment & general cleanup.</li>
				<li>Evie11: Mobile and Apple adjuster (up arrow and background), implemented background radial-blur.</li>
				<li>Alexandre Dieulot: Made instant.page, used to speed up page load times.</li>
				<li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/about/team/">Bootstrap Team</a>: Developing the CSS framework used by the website.</li>
				<li>thednp: Bootstrap Native (basically, removing jQuery) & being confusing on how to implement tool-tips for div elements.</li>
				<li>atomiks: Work around to tooltips (I wish I didn't have to use it though, because I'd much rather use the built in solution provided by native bootstrap).</li>
				<li><a href="https://opencollective.com/popperjs">PopperJS team</a>: makes tippy work, and I might do something with it later.</li>
				<li>Tropical#8908: Making the Midnight UI theme on BetterDiscord, which introduced me to the asthetic</li>
				<li>Catriona Henderson: Making the original sidebar code (modified heavily to the point where it's barely recognizable, but just saying in case).</li>
