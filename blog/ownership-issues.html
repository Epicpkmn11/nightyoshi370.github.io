			<h1 class="mb-0">Ownership issues</h1>
			<small class="font-italic font-weight-light font-underline">This is a Work In Progress</small><br><br>
			<p>I dunno why, maybe it's cursed in my blood but ownership has almost always been an issue with me. Who owns what? How much can you change until you call it yours? Is this blog even mine?</p>
			<p>Before I get into the bad experiences, I might as well mention that I do have some great experiences.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Yamamura was developed by Samplasion and myself, and we expressed that clearly. We were an unstoppable coding team, and I could not have asked for a better partner. I wish he was the partner I had for all the other stories, but I appreciate the help he gave me for Yamaumra.</li>
				<li>I wish Bun insulted me less for my writting but he's good to work with too. We actually worked together on a rule listing for Mario Making Mods, and solved an issue we had with Lightning autorole (no offense to Snowfall, of course)</li>
				<li>DeadSkullzJr and I disagree heavily on what to archive and what to not, what's considered good and what's considered not, etc. Outside of that, we actually work great together. We plan to do a new website for DS archives and I already did the engine. Best of all; I'm in the footer credits (something to keep a note of) even though he'll provide all the content.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Also keep in mind that I will not reveal any names, and most of these are from a long time ago, so if you know who they are; good for you. Please don't bring this up to them saying "I'm calling them out" since as I said, they probably don't care.</p>
			<h3>Mario Making Mods</h3>
			<p>Before I start off, keep in mind that the person I had an issue with for this is completely fine with me now, and we've gotten everything resolved. He is extremely busy with life and NEITHER of us are the owners anymore. The community is now managed by bunten and I honestly don't care about who's owner. The old URL in question no longer exists and I don't think the new URL will exist soon.</p>
			<p>So, in December of 2016, I told someone that I wanted to make a Super Mario Maker modding website. At the time, the only place was RHCafe and the SMM forum was inactive. Though, it still existed so we dropped the convo...</p>
			<p>...until the site actually got shut down pre-May 2017 due to a Memory Leak. With there being no where to go, I was thinking of the idea again. I pitched it again to the dude, but he forwarded it to someone else. We'll call this person "MappleTreeway" for privacy reasons. Anywho, mapple wanted me to go and make him the forum, and I didn't think why not. I can't remember which mods he made, but I think they were popular enough so I wanted to do it with him. I setup the host and forum while he made a trailer revealing his IP address (oops) and made a Discord Server. He setup a staff team as well, which...I'm not gonna lie, was totally awful. It seemed more as a friend hangout and close friends as admins and staff than what they actually did. By comparison, I've modded the crap out of SMM3DS, hus made a port of NSMB2 to SMM, GRA made a minecraft theme and Bun made Vanilla Revamped. It came to the point where on a 20~ish member server, 11 were staff (including myself)</p>
			<p>It only took me within two weeks to find out how shitty said team was. The owner of the server made an @everyone ping advertising the playthrough of an NSMBW mod, and then banning anyone who complained. I approached the team and told them, unaware of what they were actually doing; planning to overthrow me. They invited ALL the staff members to a group DM except me and bashed everything I did, instead of talking to me like a normal human. They claimed I did nothing except cause trouble (but I was the one who got a better host and setup the damn software. Apparently, setting up Youtube videos and an easy to replicate discord server is much more work than setting up basically your entire identity). Well, I said, I'm the person with the actual technical knowhow. You can't overthrow someone on forums without SQL knowledge, I hosted the forums and all they did is provide a domain with fake (read: illegal) meta data. I got word of them trying to overthrow me and asked one of my buddies to setup a new *simpler* domain name. We moved to mariomods.net and they stayed over at mariomakingmods.net under the name Koopa Konstructions (one of the names WE planned to change to. Now you see why I used to hate them for ripping us off?) The problem is, they didn't link to us at all. They didn't even want to help us and redirect old users to us. They just wanted all the activity, which confused quite a few people. Of course, I was banned on the spot for linking users to the old website and it stayed that way until the hosting provider stepped in and messed up the website.</p>
			<p>So, why am I bringing this up? Well, its mainly because of again, what is the proper ownership? I had ownership over the old domain contents but it wasn't redirected at all. It was my stuff, yet under their domain. This isn't the only time something like this happened, but let's save that for next section because there's still more to go off for MMM.</p>
			<p>After a host change, I met up with someone who I will not describe a single bit due to legal issues, but I ended up getting locked out of the VPS that hosted Mario Making Mods. Yes, they paid and hosted everything, but it was still my content and the content of the community that was hosted there. Is it still mine? Without them, I wouldn't have even been able to host it.</p>
			<h3>DSi Modding Guide</h3>
			<p>Well, let's jump two years later, to 2019-2020. Things were in a dire state for the Nintendo DS(i) community with FileTrip closing and GBAtemp always linking to them for anything flashcart related. I had to take things into my own hands and try to rehost everything. The GBAtemp page had an entry barrier meaning you couldn't join and would require a mod to make you an account. I couldn't risk that, so I took the source and wanted to make my own website. Another issue; GBAtemp wiki is trash. Plus, I also wanted to make a website for anything and everything DS mode related, even 3DS stuff. A DSi Guide was already made and Flipnote Lenny worked on a 3DS so I could use that as a base. I hosted it, redid some text and added the flashcart index. Problem? It was another website and no one wanted to help me. Fine, I said. I'll host the flashcart section elsewhere but I'm still doing the DSi Guide changes.</p>
			<p>At the time, the site owner was literally no where to be found so it was up to RocketRobz and any other contributor to update it, and the means of updating it were....awful. Why is there two separate pages for installing unlaunch with only one step difference? Naturally, I fixed that and decided to do much more. It went to the point where I technically rewrote the whole website, accomodating the last year of non changes. Updated it to standards, removed a few useless parts, made it into my own style, etc.. Problem? It still wasn't my website. I couldn't put my name in the footer, the icon was UGLY and it was still under a repo holder of someone who abandoned the guide.</p>
			<p>Then, out of literally nowhere, the site owner returned. She was nice, offering me half money of ads (which I think she might revoke for reasons listed later down), giving me write access to the repo & moving everything to a more streamlined place. Then, she wanted the guides to be consistent with the other cfw.guide websites, but the problem? The design philosophy that she wanted and the one between the community was vastly different.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>We already moved on from recommending hiyaCFW, due to not doing much.</li>
				<li>We would rather tell users outright if something is optional.</li>
				<li>We got rid of the Get Started button because people would click on it not reading the home page.</li>
				<li>We used tabs for things that don't require a separate page.</li>
				<li>We've decided to have anything penetrating to one application in that one page.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Well, the guide was much more, er, streamlined and basically most of the hard work I've spent hours on got removed. Most of the changed were because "I like this way" and like I said; I don't own the domain so I can't change it. She also did engine changes, reverting it back to the old MM design language without actually knowing how to do so. For example, nav links were moved from the right (aka next to the show more button and the new Minimal Mistakes design language lied) to the left.<br>
			What struck me the most was the removal of the footer credit only a few days after she said it's fine if my name was on the footer. The reason given was "it should be easy to find the site owner", yet I'm also the owner of the site since I maintained it while she was absent. But hey, it's her domain so I can't do anything...</p>
			<p>So why don't I make a new one, like I did for MMM? That would be a betray of her trust. Despite me disagreeing with her changes, we're still a team and we still work together. Besides, dsi.cfw.guide is already established, whereas MMM was just growing. It's basically "You have money and you're first? You're served". That is why I don't like the current direction and there's nothing I could do. Yes, this is useless complaining, but it only furthers my statement: What is considered ownership? All of it was revoked for "consistency" with other guides and for the changes that did remain, they weren't significant enough.</p>
			<h3>This blog</h3>
			<p>First off, I'm not talking about content. Content will always be mine and I wouldn't steal it. No point in doing so. So what do I mean?</p>
			<p>Well, I mean the actual layout of the website itself. First off, the sidebar code originated from a template I found online and I heavily modified it. Only bits and pieces of the original is there. Have I properly rewrote the sidebar code?</p>
			<p>Then there's layout, and while I use Bootstrap, I also heavily based my design based on Midnight UI. I don't steal any of their code...but I also take everything from their design. Does that make it my website? The content is what matters, but the presentation too. It's weird for me to think this, because I haven't met any of them.</p>
			<h3>Main takeaway</h3>
			<p>In life, you'll always have to use something provided by someone else. Heck, to even access this page, you have to use external contributions (people who made CSS standards, people who built your device, people who built the OS, people who build the web browser, etc...). They made these things for you though. However, know what's yours, what isn't, and the definition of ownership.</p>
