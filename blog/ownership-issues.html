			<h1 class="mb-0">Ownership issues</h1>
			<small class="font-italic font-weight-light font-underline">Published on May 12th, 2020.</small><br><br>
			<p>I dunno why, maybe it's cursed in my blood but ownership has almost always been an issue with me. Who owns what? How much can you change until you call it yours? Is this blog even mine?</p>
			<p>Before I get into the bad experiences, I might as well mention that I do have some great experiences.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Yamamura was developed by Samplasion and myself, and we expressed that clearly. We were an unstoppable coding team, and I could not have asked for a better partner. I wish he was the partner I had for all the other stories, but I appreciate the help he gave me for Yamaumra.</li>
				<li>I wish Bun insulted me less for my writting but he's good to work with too. We actually worked together on a rule listing for Mario Making Mods, and solved an issue we had with Lightning autorole (no offense to Snowfall, of course)</li>
				<li>DeadSkullzJr and I disagree heavily on what to archive and what to not, what's considered good and what's considered not, etc. Outside of that, we actually work great together. We plan to do a new website for DS archives and I already did the engine. Best of all; I'm in the footer credits (something to keep a note of) even though he'll provide all the content.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Also keep in mind that I will not reveal any names, and most of these are from a long time ago, so if you know who they are; good for you. Please don't bring this up to them saying "I'm calling them out" since as I said, they probably don't care.</p>
			<h3>Mario Making Mods</h3>
			<p>Before I start off, keep in mind that the person I had an issue with for this is completely fine with me now, and we've gotten everything resolved. He is extremely busy with life and NEITHER of us are the owners anymore. The community is now managed by bunten and I honestly don't care about who's owner. The old URL in question no longer exists and I don't think the new URL will exist soon.</p>
			<p>So, in December of 2016, I told someone that I wanted to make a Super Mario Maker modding website. At the time, the only place was RHCafe and the SMM forum was inactive. Though, it still existed so we dropped the convo...</p>
			<p>...until the site actually got shut down pre-May 2017 due to a Memory Leak. With there being no where to go, I was thinking of the idea again. I pitched it again to the dude, but he forwarded it to someone else. We'll call this person "MappleTreeway" for privacy reasons. Anywho, mapple wanted me to go and make him the forum, and I didn't think why not. I can't remember which mods he made, but I think they were popular enough so I wanted to do it with him. I setup the host and forum while he made a trailer revealing his IP address (oops) and made a Discord Server. He setup a staff team as well, which...I'm not gonna lie, was totally awful. It seemed more as a friend hangout and close friends as admins and staff than what they actually did. By comparison, I've modded the crap out of SMM3DS, hus made a port of NSMB2 to SMM, GRA made a minecraft theme and Bun made Vanilla Revamped. It came to the point where on a 20~ish member server, 11 were staff (including myself)</p>
			<p>It only took me within two weeks to find out how shitty said team was. The owner of the server made an @everyone ping advertising the playthrough of an NSMBW mod, and then banning anyone who complained. I approached the team and told them, unaware of what they were actually doing; planning to overthrow me. They invited ALL the staff members to a group DM except me and bashed everything I did, instead of talking to me like a normal human. They claimed I did nothing except cause trouble (but I was the one who got a better host and setup the damn software. Apparently, setting up Youtube videos and an easy to replicate discord server is much more work than setting up basically your entire identity). Well, I said, I'm the person with the actual technical knowhow. You can't overthrow someone on forums without SQL knowledge, I hosted the forums and all they did is provide a domain with fake (read: illegal) meta data. I got word of them trying to overthrow me and asked one of my buddies to setup a new *simpler* domain name. We moved to mariomods.net and they stayed over at mariomakingmods.net under the name Koopa Konstructions (one of the names WE planned to change to. Now you see why I used to hate them for ripping us off?) The problem is, they didn't link to us at all. They didn't even want to help us and redirect old users to us. They just wanted all the activity, which confused quite a few people. Of course, I was banned on the spot for linking users to the old website and it stayed that way until the hosting provider stepped in and messed up the website.</p>
			<p>So, why am I bringing this up? Well, its mainly because of again, what is the proper ownership? I had ownership over the old domain contents but it wasn't redirected at all. It was my stuff, yet under their domain. This isn't the only time something like this happened, but let's save that for next section because there's still more to go off for MMM.</p>
			<p>After a host change, I met up with someone who I will not describe a single bit due to legal issues, but I ended up getting locked out of the VPS that hosted Mario Making Mods. Yes, they paid and hosted everything, but it was still my content and the content of the community that was hosted there. Is it still mine? Without them, I wouldn't have even been able to host it.</p>
			<h3>DSi Modding Guide</h3>
			<p>Well, let's jump two years later, to 2019-2020. Things were in a dire state for the Nintendo DS(i) community with FileTrip closing and GBAtemp always linking to them for anything flashcart related. I had to take things into my own hands and try to rehost everything. The GBAtemp wiki had an entry barrier meaning you couldn't join and would require a wiki administrator to make you an account. I couldn't risk them not responding to my messages since FileTrip was so close to closing. I took the Wiki code, converted it to MarkDown manually, added new firmwares/kernels and put it on my website. Another issue; GBAtemp wiki is trash. Plus, I also wanted to make a website for anything and everything DS mode related, even for the Nintendo 3DS's TWL_FIRM. A guide on modding the Nintendo DSi was already made and Flipnote Lenny worked on a 3DS so I could use that as a base. I forked the repo, added the flashcart index above and redid some of the text. It was mine alright, but it was another website and not the main one people would link to. People would say my website is "out of date" imediately after making a PR changing a version of a software used, so it was clear no one wanted to help. Fine, I said. I'll host the flashcart section elsewhere but I'm still doing the DSi Guide changes.</p>
			<p>At the time, the site owner was literally no where to be found so it was up to RocketRobz and any other contributor to update it, and the means of updating it were....awful. Why is there two separate pages for installing unlaunch with only one step difference? Naturally, I fixed that and decided to do much more. It went to the point where I technically rewrote the whole website, accommodating the last year of non changes. Updated it to standards, removed a few useless parts, made it into my own style, etc.. Problem? It still wasn't my website. I couldn't put my name in the footer, the icon was still the icon that was made in two seconds and the repo was under someone who abandoned the guide.</p>
			<p>Then, out of literally nowhere, the site owner returned. She was nice, offering me half money of ads (which I think she might revoke for reasons listed later down), giving me write access to the repo & moving everything to a more streamlined place. Then, she wanted the guides to be consistent with the other cfw.guide websites, but the problem? The design philosophy that she wanted and the one within the community was vastly different.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>We already moved on from recommending hiyaCFW, due to not doing much.</li>
				<li>We would rather tell users outright if something is optional.</li>
				<li>We got rid of the Get Started button because people would click on it not reading the home page.</li>
				<li>We used tabs for things that don't require a separate page.</li>
				<li>We've decided to have anything pertaining to one application in that page dedicated to them.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Well, the guide was much more, er, streamlined and basically most of the hard work I've spent hours on got removed. Most of the changed were because "I like this way" and "it works elsewhere". As I said before, I don't own the domain so I can't change it. She also did engine changes, reverting it back to the old MM design language without actually knowing how to do so. For example, nav links were moved from the right (aka next to the show more button and the new Minimal Mistakes design language) to the left.<br>
			What struck me the most was the removal of the footer credit only a few days after she said it's fine if my name was on the footer. The reason given was "it should be easy to find the site owner", yet I'm also the owner of the site since I maintained it while she was absent. But hey, it's her domain so I can't do anything...</p>
			<p>So why don't I make a new Ninetndo DSi Modding Guide? I was certainly fine with having a new URL for MMM, so why not repeat that? The one mistake I made with Mario Making Mods was that there was a community split, since as mentioned above, no one knew we moved. I didn't want to do the same here, especially for a well-established community such as the Nintendo DSi Homebrew Scene. Super Mario Maker Modding was still growing, so I could take chances. Basically, it was "You have money to buy a domain and you're first? Go ahead and you're basically owner". Besides, the owner and I are a team and we still do work together. I shouldn't be salty over all my work being thrown out, and taking matters into my own hands would be a betrayal of her trust. I'm surprised she even sent me a FR on discord in the first place. Yes, this is useless complaining, but it only furthers my statement: What is considered ownership? All of it was revoked for "consistency" with other guides and for the changes that did remain, they weren't significant enough.</p>
			<h3>This blog</h3>
			<p>First off, I'm not talking about content. Content will always be mine and I wouldn't steal it. No point in doing so, since this is supposed to be NightScript's domain, not NightScript & co. I would get help writing a few things, but ideas are entirely mine. So what do I mean?</p>
			<p>Well, I mean the actual layout of the website itself. First off, the sidebar code originated from a template I found online and I heavily modified it. Only bits and pieces of the original is there. Have I properly rewrote the sidebar code?</p>
			<p>Then there's layout, and while I use Bootstrap, I also heavily based my design based on Midnight UI. I don't steal any of their code...but I also take everything from their design. Does that make it my website? The content is what matters, but the presentation too. It's weird for me to think this, because I haven't met any of them.</p>
			<h3>Discord Bots</h3>
			<p>Before we begin, please note that I will not be looking into every bot. Some of them (like Kurisu) have had hours of work spent into it and they couldn't copy paste because no other modding bot existed like Kurisu at the time of its development. I will, however, be looking at parts of Yamamura (my own Discord Bot) and over 122K bots hosted on BotGhost. Are those really your bots?</p>
			<p>Most discord bots are just front end to libraries. Discord.JS Music Bots? You connect to Youtube and then use Discord.JS's music player. You haven't done anything other than stitch things. BotGhost bots? It's literally pay them, select things from a menu and then your bot is there. Again, you haven't done anything. People who blindly follow video guides are even worse, since you are literally copy pasting from others. So what makes a Discord Bot yours in those instances?</p>
			<p>The fact that you control it. Yep, that's how all these above cases work. You get to control who uses it and who can't. Most users would call that a blacklist, but I call it theft. Who are you to decide who uses other peoples services? You haven't coded anything other than a frontend (probably stolen) for the service.</p>
			<p>To be fair, I'm guilty of this too. I never blacklisted anyone in Yamamura (though I was very close to doing so), but there are times where I would take someone elses code. The difference? I try to make it unique by introducing my own spins to it.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Image commands layered and properly resized.</li>
				<li>The poll command got many improvements to functionality.</li>
				<li>The initial points code was made by Hindsight. Samplasion and I introduced balancing of levels, switched to a new DB engine and much more.</li>
				<li>The video selection queue was complex and used a design language.</li>
				<li>In fact, most things have my unique design language, of having anything bonus in the embed with anything mandatory in the main message.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Main takeaway</h3>
			<p>In life, you'll always have to use something provided by someone else. Heck, to even access this page, you have to use external contributions (people who made CSS standards, people who built your device, people who built the OS, people who build the web browser, etc...). They made these things for you though. However, know what's yours, what isn't, and the definition of ownership.</p>
			<p>Personally, how have I changed? The Mario Making Mods website is now dead so shouldn't all the work go back to the person who made the Discord Server? Well, he didn't maintain it well, only had 20 members and ended up shutting down. I guess it would have happened to the true MMM if I didn't move it. Besides, his vision and mine were different, so I guess I could say that Bunten and I own Mario Making Mods properly. Now, you could still argue on the forum engine, but the forum engine was also changed from Blargboard to MakerBoard. Yes, MakerBoard is a fork, but I'd say that barely any of the original code remains; I changed it WAY too much. Either way, I've stopped PHP dev and if I wanted to make a website, I'd use Node.JS. Even if Node.JS were backwards compatible with PHP code, I would NOT use it. So, there's that in regards to forums in general.</p>
			<p>For Yamamura, it's right now fully gone. However, if it were to stay alive, most of the copy paste code wouldn't have even worked with the rewrite I was planning. Basically, it was supposed to separate backend (bot code) from frontend (Discord) so we could port it over to other platforms if I would ever want to switch away from Discord (something I'm thinking about doing honestly).</p>
			<p>This blog? Well, as I said, it's both engine and content that matters. I built the engine on top of Bootstrap and the sidebar code I based it on can no longer be recognizable. Besides, the website still WORKS without bootstrap. For the parts I did directly copy paste from others, I've credited. Evie11 helped me and she deserved the credits I gave her in the website information page.</p>
			<p>I sadly can't say anything about how dsi.cfw.guide would go. As I said, I'm in a spot where I can't do anything because the original is already so prevelant and anything I do would be miniscule and trying to contribute to the main guide would be pointless cause I have a very different design language from the original author and all my work did end up getting thrown out.</p>
			<p>How I will go about doing things in the future though is what can be improved. For DeadSkullzJr's website, I already self-made the engine. The only thing I took from others was the bootstrap container code for a slim web page contents. The rest is my own except the contents which is DeadSkullzJr. He already said we'll credit eachother fairly for the work we've both put in. This is as smooth as how it was for Samplasion and I in Yamamura and here's hoping to many more fun collaborations between individual developers.</p>
