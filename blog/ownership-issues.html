					<p>For some reason, I have been having issues with ownership. What's the coorolation between ownership and power? What do you truely own? How much can you change a product until it is deemed yours?</p>
					<p>Before I get into the bad experiences, I might as well mention that I do have some great experiences.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Yamamura was developed by Samplasion and myself, and we expressed that clearly. We were an unstoppable coding team, and I could not have asked for a better partner. I wish he was the partner I had for all the other stories, but I appreciate the help he gave me for Yamaumra.</li>
						<li>I wish Bun insulted me less for my writing but he's good to work with too. We actually worked together on a rule listing for Mario Making Mods, and solved an issue we had with Lightning autorole (no offense to Snowfall, of course)</li>
						<li>DeadSkullzJr and I disagree heavily on what to archive and what to not, what's considered good and what's considered not, etc. Outside of that, we actually work great together. We plan to do a new website for DS archives and I already did the engine. Best of all; I'm in the footer credits (something to keep a note of) even though he'll provide all the content.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Also keep in mind that I will not reveal any names since this isn't trying to be a call out post. This is rather my personal experiences with ownership issues and I'm just listing my frustrations. I don't mean any hate to any of the people I rag on here (except power abusers in Discord bots) and most of these are from a long time ago. If you know who they are; good for you. Please don't bring this up to them saying "NightScript is calling you out" since this isn't the intention.</p>
					<h3>Mario Making Mods - Co-Owner issus</h3>
					<!--<p>So, in December of 2016, I told someone that I wanted to make a forum dedicated to Super Mario Maker modding. The community was small but there was potential, so I thought making a dedicated forum would take advantage of it. At the time, the only place that hosted SMM modding was RHCafe and even though it was inactive, it still existed. We left off the convo until the site shut down, when I brought up the idea again. He forwarded it to someone else, who then wanted me to do all the work and make him co-owner. I can't remember which mods he made, but I think they were popular enough so I knew he was knowledgable enough. I setup the host and forum while he made a trailer of the forum (in where he revealed his IP address) and made the Discord Server. He setup a staff team as well, which...I'm not gonna lie, was totally awful. It seemed more as a friend hangout and close friends as admins and staff than what they actually did. He had so many people on his list that out of 20~ish server members, 11 of them (myself included) were staff members.</p>
					<p>To compare this to our current staff listing (at the time of writing this article), we have four staff members moderating a ~500 member discord server.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>I've ported numerous Super Mario Maker Wii U themes to the Nintendo 3DS port of Super Mario Maker & documented the changes made with every update.</li>
						<li>GRAnimated made a Minecraft theme (that replaces Super Mario World) for the Wii U version of Super Mario Maker & has documented numerous unused assets.</li>
						<li>hus made a New Super Mario Bros 2 game style mod that replaces NSMBU for both the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS versions of Super Mario Maker.</li>
						<li>bunten (the current owner) made one of the most positively-recieved Super Mario Maker mods titled Super Mario Maker: Vanilla Revamped.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Didn't take me that long to fine out how awful said "team" was. Within two weeks of the platform, the owner of the server made an @everyone ping advertising the playthrough of an NSMBW mod, and then banning anyone who complained about the ping. I approached the team and tried to resolve many things. In truth, they were planning to resolve things on their own. Their results? Trying to overthrow me by inviting every staff member except JedaYoshi and I and bashing everything I did, instead of attempting to communicate properly with me. Their claims were I had done nothing except cause trouble and they did everything. Apparently, making a screen recording with a voice over, making an easy to replicate Discord Server and buying a domain with fake (read: illegal) metadata is much more work then getting said product you're trying to advertise in your video up and running. Well, I said, I'm the person with the actual technical knowledge. In blargboard, you need to use SQL in order to change the role (which were called Primary Groups) of an owner. I already planned to overthrow them, since it was my software and again, they didn't really do anything. When I got word of them trying to overthrow me, I setup a new domain name and demoted them. We moved to mariomods.net and I let them keep mariomakingmods.net. Their responses weren't that great.
					<p>While I was gone for a 3 day vacation, I was the subject matter for many hateful youtube videos, trying to "expose" me for "stealing" their stuff. With fake content being thrown everywhere, it was quite annoying. Well, I hope they would let us have our stuff but nope. Since two websites under the same name would confuse literally everyone, they decided to change the name to one that we tried to change ours too: Koopa Konstructions. This was brought up in one of their <b>four</b> group DMs trying to trashtalk me behind my back. I'm fine with them making a community of their own, and hey, it was their domain; they should be able to use it. Problem? They tried to hoard anyone that wasn't aware that we moved with their ripoff. They added random forums to keep "activity" but they weren't even related at all. How could a URL be called mariomakingmods.net, have a title of "Koopa Konstructions" and include random Animal Crossing modding forums? To the users who wanted to know what happened to the old website, they were simply unaware. It just seemed as if the forums reset, and people were tired of making new accounts any time the software got hacked. Of course, I was banned on the spot for linking users to the old website and it stayed that way until the hosting provider stepped in and messed up the website.</p>-->
					<p>So, in December of 2016, I told someone that I wanted to make a forum dedicated to Super Mario Maker modding. The community was small but there was potential, so I thought making a dedicated forum would take advantage of it. At the time, the only place that hosted SMM modding was RHCafe and even though it was inactive, it still existed. We left off the convo until the site shut down, when I brought up the idea again. He forwarded it to someone else, who then wanted to team up with me. The mods made were quite popular at the time (read: pre Blue Television Games era) so I knew he could help out. While he bought a URL, I setup the forums. However, two weeks in, things started to get a little bit frustrating between his team and I. We ended up splitting and since he had the URL, he could do whatever he wants. He set up his own forum under the old URL, but no one was aware we moved. To be fair, he didn't have to; why would he advertise a competitor? But then again, it was my content under his URL; did that make it his content?</p>
					<p>The timeline moves on to late October 2017. I was now found with a new host with an owner who I will not describe a single bit due to potential legal issues I might have. The basic jist is that we did not communicate properly and I ended up getting locked out of the VPS that hosted Mario Making Mods. I had to get in through an alternative account I made to get all my data, so I was now being locked out of my own content. After that, I had to self-host the forums under my money. The problem was I picked an awful VPS host which means I was not getting my moneys worth. It lasted until mid 2018, where I couldn't refill my prepaid credit card. At that point, I came into contact with the person who hosted rverse since I couldn't afford to go with someone who asked money from me. This was the second time I took chances with letting my content be hosted with someone else and it took a complete unexpected 180 on me. Unlike the person I had dealt with before, this new person was nice and was glad to help out another fellow modding community. However, they did shady things which I do not feel comfortable enough talking about here. The case in point is that we got locked out multiple times, and Oman Computar had to pay from their own pocket in order to keep the VPS going. At that point, wouldn't it be considered Oman's VPS?</p>
					<p>So, why am I bringing this up? This all happened in 2017-2018, yet it was the start for ownership issues for me. For one, the contents of the old URL were mine yet it was his URL. The contents of the VPS was mine yet it was paid by outsiders. Was I truely the owner of Mario Making Mods? Or was it me and some other people?</p>
					<h3>DSi Modding Guide - what wasn't mine isn't mine</h3>
					<p>Well, let's jump to an entirely different time point, to 2019-2020. At this point, I've completely lost interest in Mario Maker modding and have moved onto another aspect of nostalgia: the Nintendo DS. Since I've learned what flashcarts were, I was obsessed with them going as far as attempting to buy them...twice. While I was never able to get any myself, I was still glad I could experience their magical homebrew via nds-bootstrap. A huge congrats to RocketRobz, ahezard, shutterbug2000 and everyone else involved for nds-bootstrap and it was a good alternative for non-flashcart owners such as myself. Unfortunately, FileTrip would announce its closure for April 2019 and with it, a bunch of flashcart kernels. I felt it was important to have all those kernels backed up as it allow new flashcart owners to experienced all the homebrew I fell in love with. There was already an index page on the GBAtemp wiki listing all the FileTrip links, but I couldn't edit it as I needed a GBAtemp wiki account. In order to get a GBAtemp wiki account, you'd have to ask a wiki administrator. I didn't want to take the risk of the list being down forever because a GBAtemp admin didn't respond to me. What I did instead was take the Wiki code, convert it to Markdown and place the new list (with the new links pointing to a GitHub repository I made) on a fork I made for a universal DSi Guide website.</p>
					<p>The website was a hot mess and extremely confusing for anyone that wasn't 2019-me. Plus, no one wanted to help support it. I reached out to DeadSkullzJr who was trying to work on his own list, so I didn't want to bother him. Besides, at the time, I wasn't as good of friends with him as I am right now; I hardly knew him. The people on DS(i) Mode Hacking would claim my website is "out of date" the day after making a Pull Request to the main DSi Guide just with a version change. It was quite clear that changes had to be made on my part. Since I couldn't do things on my own, I thought I might be able to contribute to already existing resources. I wanted to keep the flashcart list on a separate website since I wanted to make it into a fully fledged guide. The 3DS stuff was miniscule and already self-explanatory so those could be removed. However, there were changes I made to the DSi Guide and since it's a fork of the true DSi Guide, I figured moving all my changes there would be better for the community.</p>
					<p>At the time, the site owner was literally no where to be found so it was up to RocketRobz and any other contributor to update it, and the means of updating it were...awful. Why is there two separate pages for installing unlaunch with only one section difference? I fixed that and decided to do much more. It went to the point where I technically rewrote the whole website, accommodating the last year of non changes. Updated it to standards, removed a few useless parts, made it into my own style, etc.. Problem? It still wasn't my website. I couldn't put my name in the footer, the icon was still the icon that was made in two seconds and the repo was under someone who abandoned the guide.</p>
					<p>Then, out of literally nowhere, the site owner returned. She was nice, offering me half money of ads (which I think she might revoke for reasons listed later down), giving me write access to the repo & moving everything to a more streamlined place. Then, she wanted the guides to be consistent with the other cfw.guide websites, but the problem? The design philosophy that she wanted and the one within the community was vastly different.</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>We already moved on from recommending hiyaCFW, due to not doing much.</li>
						<li>We would rather tell users outright if something is optional.</li>
						<li>We got rid of the Get Started button because people would click on it not reading the home page.</li>
						<li>We used tabs for things that don't require a separate page.</li>
						<li>We've decided to have anything pertaining to one application in that page dedicated to them.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Well, the guide was much more, er, streamlined and basically most of the hard work I've spent hours on got removed, for the reasons of "I like this way" and "it works elsewhere". The engine changes also reverted the website back to the old design language of Minimal Mistakes. For example, in the new Minimal Mistakes, topbar links were on the righthand side. This makes so much sense when you take into account that the "show more" button was also on the right hand side and this is also GBAtemp's old design too (which means that it was also used by Yamamura & MakerBoard). Well, it was reverted to be "consistent" with the other guides. She reverted it wrongly too, breaking the cross-compatibility and had CSS conflicts. When bringing up the point of it being next to the show more button, she said the "show more" button would rarely appear, and that's nice and all if you have a display that can acommodate all the links. It's even worse than how I did it since she added the TroubleShooting page to the top links and an uninstalling unlaunch page. With the exception of "FAQ", every link there has text of atleast 13 characters, so even on a 1920x1080 display, the show more button would pop up. 1080p is literally called High Definition, so what is the norm to view the site on? 2K and 4K?</p>
					<p>Might I add, that top links are supposed to acommodate the site in general, and they are what users see on every page. They are supposed to be easy links, and links people would often click on. Mario Making Mods had depot on the top bar since people would often check out the SMM mods. So why is the Uninstalling Unlaunch page on there? If it'd be shown on every screen, it would make people think "oh, why would I install it? It seems to be quite popular to get rid of it because it's on the top bar". Well, to answer that? Because the design of the owner and the design of, basically the web, is different. The top bar links are supposed to be "add-on" sections for the guide, not things users would click on often. To respond to that mindset, the top links is missing Installing Unlaunch, Installing hiyaCFW & File Extensions (Windows). These are considered addons, despite them not accomodating the website in general. Oh yeah, that's my second point; it isn't accomodating the website in general so those top links shouldn't even be there. That design goes against the standard web design for top links.</p>
					<p>Site Navigation is also weird. How I handled it was in order of things happening in the guide. That way, you could easily jump back to a page of the guide. The new way has it alphabetical, which doesn't benefit anyone at all. For the main guide sections, the links in Site Navigation are in 2, 3, 4, 1. Why? 1 starts with L and 2 starts with D. Oh, and the diffs are messed up too, since there were random renames for seamingly no reason. Heck, the renames actually broke the redirects made to acommodate old links. See, installing-unlaunch was the old link, back when everything was one page. I split the pages into 3 and redirected installing-unlaunch to exploit launch (the new first page). The new guide kept the split pages but renamed unlaunch to installing-unlaunch aka the old page name. Now, when people link to the old guide, they'll only get part 3 of the whole 3 parts. Now the new question would be "I was linked to the guide but now how do I launch this <code>.nds</code> file?", when that was explained in the first page.</p>
					<p>Amids all the mess created, it was technically a full rewrite so my name was removed from the footer, days after she said it was fine. The reason given was "it should be easy to find the site owner", yet I'm also the owner of the site since I maintained it while she was absent. But hey, it's her domain so I can't do anything...or could I? Why couldn't I repeat the Mario Making Mods situation, where I create my own domain? The situation is different though...</p>
					<p>The one mistake I made with Mario Making Mods was that there was a community split. No one not on the discord server knew we moved and any mention of me mentioning we moved was banned. I didn't want to do the same here, especially for a well-established community such as the Nintendo DSi Homebrew Scene. With the Super Mario Maker Modding scene, it just started two weeks prior so I could have taken a chance, but this guide was around since 2018. Basically, it was "You have money to buy a domain and you're first? Go ahead and you're basically owner of the guide community". Besides, the owner and I are a team and we still do work together. I shouldn't be salty over all my work being thrown out, and taking matters into my own hands would be a betrayal of her trust. With Mario Making Mods, the co-owner wanted to overthrow me from what was mine so I didn't care about being rude. This guide was never mine and the DSi Guide owner certainly has never done such mean things. I'm surprised she even sent me a FR on discord in the first place. Yes, this is useless complaining, but it only furthers my statement: What is considered ownership? All of it was revoked for "consistency" with other guides and for the changes that did remain, they weren't significant enough.</p>
					<h3>Discord Bots - The eventual end to everything & the answer to all</h3>
					<p>Before we begin, please note that I will not be looking into every bot. Some of them (like Kurisu) have had hours of work spent into it and they couldn't copy paste because no other modding bot existed like Kurisu at the time of its development. I will, however, be looking at parts of Yamamura (my own Discord Bot) and over 122K bots hosted on BotGhost. Are those really your bots?</p>
					<p>Most discord bots are just front end to libraries. Discord.JS Music Bots? You connect to Youtube and then use Discord.JS's music player. You haven't done anything other than stitch things. BotGhost bots? It's literally pay them, select things from a menu and then your bot is there. Again, you haven't done anything. People who blindly follow video guides are even worse, since you are literally copy pasting from others. So what makes a Discord Bot yours in those instances?</p>
					<p>The fact that you control it. Yep, that's how all these above cases work. You get to control who uses it and who can't. Most users would call that a blacklist, but I call it theft. Who are you to decide who uses other peoples services? You haven't coded anything other than a frontend (probably stolen) for the service.</p>
					<p>To be fair, I'm guilty of this too. I never blacklisted anyone in Yamamura (though I was very close to doing so), but there are times where I would take someone else's code. The difference? I try to make it unique by introducing my own spins to it.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Image commands layered and properly resized.</li>
						<li>The poll command got many improvements to functionality.</li>
						<li>The initial points code was made by Hindsight. Samplasion and I introduced balancing of levels, switched to a new DB engine and much more.</li>
						<li>The video selection queue was complex and used a design language.</li>
						<li>In fact, most things have my unique design language, of having anything bonus in the embed with anything mandatory in the main message.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Bonus: This website - Unusual Conflict</h3>
					<p>I've decided to add in a little segment here about this very website. It doesn't fit in the above sections and not with my plot progression of "power is everything", but I still wanted to present the personal conflict I have.</p>
					<p>First off, I'm not talking about content. Content will always be mine and I wouldn't steal it. No point in doing so, since this is supposed to be NightScript's domain, not NightScript & co. I would get help writing a few things, but ideas are entirely mine. So what do I mean?</p>
					<p>Well, I mean the actual layout of the website itself. First off, the sidebar code originated from a template I found online and I heavily modified it. Only bits and pieces of the original is there. Are the changes made enough to be called "my own sidebar code"?</p>
					<p>The actual layout of the website is designed around the blue midnight mountain asthetic found in the Midnight UI custom theme for Discord. I didn't steal any of their code, but just the color asthetic used. Plus, this was all coded ontop of the Bootstrap CSS Framework. As it is right now, the UI is a weird mismap between a minified sidebar design and an asthetic from Midnight UI. The unique features to differentiate myself in terms of UI is the background & the sidebar design.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The background used in Midnight UI is a macOS background while I pulled up a background from Google Images</li>
						<li>The sidebar design does not match up with either designs. The template code used extremely padded sidebar elements with a border (aka not sleek and modern). Midnight UI has all the links have a grey background meaning not directly embedded into the page. My design has the links directly on top of the sidebar with slim padding and no borders.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>To take context into perspective though, the sidebar design is so different that no one would realize what it what once was. BetterDiscord isn't commonly used and most people who use it don't use Midnight UI. Plus, from a first glance, the untrained eye wouldn't be able to tell that these two have any similarities because the sidebar and background differences. That's why I'm not worried for this website. It's weird for me to bring this up though, because I've never had any interactions with either of these developers. If they do mind though, I'll change it.</p>
					<h3>Main takeaway</h3>
					<p>In life, you'll always have to use something provided by someone else. Heck, to even access this page, you have to use external contributions (people who made CSS standards, people who built your device, people who built the OS, people who build the web browser, etc...). They made these things for you though. However, know what's yours, what isn't, and the definition of ownership.</p>
					<!--<p>Personally, how have I changed? The Mario Making Mods website is now dead so shouldn't all the work go back to the person who made the Discord Server? Well, he didn't maintain it well, only had 20 members and ended up shutting down. I guess it would have happened to the true MMM if I didn't move it. Besides, his vision and mine were different, so I guess I could say that Bunten and I own Mario Making Mods properly. Now, you could still argue on the forum engine, but the forum engine was also changed from Blargboard to MakerBoard. Yes, MakerBoard is a fork, but I'd say that barely any of the original code remains; I changed it WAY too much. Either way, I've stopped PHP dev and if I wanted to make a website, I'd use Node.JS. Even if Node.JS were backwards compatible with PHP code, I would NOT use it. So, there's that in regards to forums in general.<br>
					The outcome regarding the individual users? I'm fine with the owner, but out of the 10 other staff members, only 2 of them are cool with me. Not once have the others tried to apologize. Well, I hope life takes them well enough, cause looking where they are right now, their situation aint pretty. One of them made a NSMBW mod which got criticizm the creator couldn't handle so they quit modding "forever". The second guy makes videos on Five Nights at Freddy and aims to make every character not scary from every series possible. The two who apologized? One makes music and plays geometry dash. The other makes music, turns out to be trans, plays through SMM levels as well as challenge vids and game mods daily. I've joined a few of their streams and I wish they would check the chat more often but they do have quite the following.</p> -->
					<p>For Mario Making Mods, both websites are now dead and so is the original discord server. For an archive, I plan to make it a static website on GitHub pages so there wouldn't be any issues with hosting. As for URL, I think the new URL will be gone after May 28th, 2020. If that is the case, I'll use the traditional github.io URL, and again; discord is a coorporation and not individual users. Besides, in regards to ownership issues, neither of us own Mario Making Mods anymore. On August 2019, I have transfered ownership to bunten due to wanting to focus more on school and homework, and I wasn't involved with where the server was heading. The original account of the co-owner got deleted by discord team (unfairly, might I add) and I wonder if the Mario Making Mods discord server would have been deleted as well if he was still owner. Though, GRAnimated found his new discord account, we met up and laughed at our old management tactics. I had more listed on this page but honestly, that'd just drama fuel and not really part of the "guide to ownership" so I dropped it. I still feel it was kind of worth keeping it <i>somewhere</i>, since this is a personal blog. If you do find it, do note that reading it would go against the other person's wishes.</p>
					<p>Yamamura is right now in a state of limbo. Officially, I don't give support and I no longer host the bot, but someone could obviously rehost it. The parts that are mine? Yeah, I definitely want credit for all the work I've sinked it, but what really is mine and not? However, in a hypothetical situation where Yamamura would have continued on, that would no longer be an issue. Basically, I planned to code a rewrite where the backend (bot code) and the front end (Discord) were separate, so the bot would be able to be used on other platforms. It would also be in ES6 using modular import/export and not commonJS require. Both of those things would involve basically making the bot entirely from scratch with only a few things being able to have a direct port and those things would be extremely miniscule. I don't think that rewrite would ever happen though, since Yamamura won't officially come back any time soon.</p>
					<p>People who just select elements from a User Interface and host the bot on BotGhost are sorry to hear that the bot will never be truely theirs. Once BotGhost shuts down, that means that all the 122K bots hosted there will also be dead. However, this does get you into the possible realm of bot development. Heck, copy pasting template code is better than a User Interface, because you will be able to see what each line of code does, modify it to suit your purposes and do your own thing. If any of you out there use BotGhost and want to start going into proper bot development, the easiest language to use is Node.JS with discord.js as the API communicator. There is a really easy guide on how to use discord.js by Hindsight and York, called <a href="https://anidiots.guide">anidiots.guide</a>. Don't worry; you're not an idiot for not knowing how to code. Everyone just needs to start somewhere. Hopefully you can get to the point of making fully custom bots and get your bot extremely popular, now that your bot is not a walking advertisement for "cheap" & "laziness".</p>
					<p>This website (and any type of website in general) is composed of both engine and content. I built the engine on top of the Bootstrap CSS framework and the sidebar code is barely recognizable to the original. For custom made things, however, I gave proper credit when applicable. Evie11 helped me with Apple and Mobile support specifically for the intents of this webiste, so they deserve all the credit they got in the website information page. Content is always my own, so I feel safe saying that I created and maintained ~97% of the website. Only things stopping me is the assistance from Evie and building the website on top of bootstrap v4, but at that point, it's fine to give credit. I already did most of the work so just credit the helpers and move on. It's useless to make a big deal over it.</p>
					<p>I sadly can't say anything about how dsi.cfw.guide would go. The spot the guide is currently going is where the original has existed for so long, on a better domain and is so prevalent that no one would use my version. Attempting to contribute to the main guide is meaningless since our design philosophies are different.</p>
					<p>To be honest, I'm glad that these ownership issues have occured. With all this experience, I know how I will go about doing anything going forwards. My next project where I will colaborate with someone else is DeadSkullzJr's archive for Nintendo DS. I have already created the engine used and since DeadSkullzJr doesn't know how to do one himself (no offense), I'm already credited for that. Even if he could switch, he wouldn't. Unlike the other people I've had issues with, he knows how to credit fairly (that's one of the requirements for a preservation place). Working with him is extremely smooth, and it opened me up for more colaborations. If you ever need any help in any of your projects, let me know. Just, make sure you keep a diff so I know what's mine and what's yours.</p>
