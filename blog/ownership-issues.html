			<h1 class="mb-0">Ownership issues</h1>
			<small class="font-italic font-weight-light font-underline">Published on May 12th, 2020.</small><br><br>
			<p>I dunno why, maybe it's cursed in my blood but ownership has almost always been an issue with me. Who owns what? How much can you change until you call it yours? Is this blog even mine?</p>
			<p>Before I get into the bad experiences, I might as well mention that I do have some great experiences.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Yamamura was developed by Samplasion and myself, and we expressed that clearly. We were an unstoppable coding team, and I could not have asked for a better partner. I wish he was the partner I had for all the other stories, but I appreciate the help he gave me for Yamaumra.</li>
				<li>I wish Bun insulted me less for my writting but he's good to work with too. We actually worked together on a rule listing for Mario Making Mods, and solved an issue we had with Lightning autorole (no offense to Snowfall, of course)</li>
				<li>DeadSkullzJr and I disagree heavily on what to archive and what to not, what's considered good and what's considered not, etc. Outside of that, we actually work great together. We plan to do a new website for DS archives and I already did the engine. Best of all; I'm in the footer credits (something to keep a note of) even though he'll provide all the content.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Also keep in mind that I will not reveal any names, and most of these are from a long time ago, so if you know who they are; good for you. Please don't bring this up to them saying "I'm calling them out" since as I said, they probably don't care.</p>
			<h3>Mario Making Mods</h3>
			<p>Before I start off, keep in mind that the person I had an issue with for this is completely fine with me now, and we've gotten everything resolved. He is extremely busy with life and NEITHER of us are the owners anymore. The community is now managed by bunten and I honestly don't care about who's owner. The old URL in question no longer exists and I don't think the new URL will exist soon.</p>
			<p>So, in December of 2016, I told someone that I wanted to make a forum dedicated to Super Mario Maker modding. The community was small but there was potential, so I thought making a dedicated forum would take advantage of it. At the time, the only place that hosted SMM modding was RHCafe and even though it was inactive, it still existed. We left off the convo until the site shut down, when I brought up the idea again. He forwarded it to someone else, who then wanted me to do all the work and make him co-owner. I can't remember which mods he made, but I think they were popular enough so I knew he was knowledgable enough. I setup the host and forum while he made a trailer of the forum (in where he revealed his IP address) and made the Discord Server. He setup a staff team as well, which...I'm not gonna lie, was totally awful. It seemed more as a friend hangout and close friends as admins and staff than what they actually did. By comparison, at the time of writting this blog entry, bunten, myself, GRAnimated and hus are the current staff members of Mario Making Mods. I've modded the crap out of Nintendo 3DS port of Super Mario Maker, hus made a NSMB2 theme to the Wii U and 3DS versions of Super Mario Maker, GRAnimated made a Minecraft theme and Bunten made Super Mario Maker: Vanilla Revamped. Back to the original staff team, it took over the member count. Out of the 20~ish members on the server, 11 of them (myself included) were staff members.</p>
			<p>Didn't take me that long to fine out how awful said "team" was. Within two weeks of the platform, the owner of the server made an @everyone ping advertising the playthrough of an NSMBW mod, and then banning anyone who complained about the ping. I approached the team and tried to resolve many things. In truth, they were planning to resolve things on their own. Their results? Trying to overthrow me by inviting every staff member except JedaYoshi and I and bashing everything I did, instead of attempting to communicate properly with me. Their claims were I had done nothing except cause trouble and they did everything. Apparently, making a screen recording with a voice over, making an easy to replicate Discord Server and buying a domain with fake (read: illegal) metadata is much more work then getting said product you're trying to advertise in your video up and running. Well, I said, I'm the person with the actual technical knowledge. In blargboard, you need to use SQL in order to change the role (which were called Primary Groups) of an owner. I already planned to overthrow them, since it was my software and again, they didn't really do anything. When I got word of them trying to overthrow me, I setup a new domain name and demoted them. We moved to mariomods.net and I let them keep mariomakingmods.net. Their responses weren't that great.
			<p>While I was gone for a 3 day vacation, I was the subject matter for many hateful youtube videos, trying to "expose" me for "stealing" their stuff. With fake content being thrown everywhere, it was quite annoying. Well, I hope they would let us have our stuff but nope. Since two websites under the same name would confuse literally everyone, they decided to change the name to one that we tried to change ours too: Koopa Konstructions. This was brought up in one of their <b>four</b> group DMs trying to trashtalk me behind my back. I'm fine with them making a community of their own, and hey, it was their domain; they should be able to use it. Problem? They tried to hoard anyone that wasn't aware that we moved with their ripoff. They added random forums to keep "activity" but they weren't even related at all. How could a URL be called mariomakingmods, have the title be "Koopa Konstructions" and the content be of Animal Crossing modding? Heck, the AC game being talked about was Wild World and LeafEdit hasn't even existed at the time, making modding Wild World annoying. To the users who wanted to know what happened to the old website, they were simply unaware. It just seemed as if the forums reset, and people were tired of making new accounts any time the software got hacked. Of course, I was banned on the spot for linking users to the old website and it stayed that way until the hosting provider stepped in and messed up the website.</p>
			<p>So, why am I bringing this up? Well, its mainly because of again, what is the proper ownership? I had ownership over the old domain contents but it wasn't redirected at all. It was my stuff, yet under their domain. This isn't the only time something like this happened, but let's save that for next section because there's still more to go off for MMM.</p>
			<p>After a host change, I met up with someone who I will not describe a single bit due to legal issues, but I ended up getting locked out of the VPS that hosted Mario Making Mods. Yes, they paid and hosted everything, but it was still my content and the content of the community that was hosted there. Is it still mine? Without them, I wouldn't have even been able to host it.</p>
			<h3>DSi Modding Guide</h3>
			<p>Well, let's jump two years later, to 2019-2020. Things were in a dire state for the Nintendo DS(i) community with FileTrip closing and GBAtemp always linking to them for anything flashcart related. I had to take things into my own hands and try to rehost everything. The GBAtemp wiki had an entry barrier meaning you couldn't join and would require a wiki administrator to make you an account. I couldn't risk them not responding to my messages since FileTrip was so close to closing. I took the Wiki code, converted it to MarkDown manually, added new firmwares/kernels and put it on my website. Another issue; GBAtemp wiki is trash. Plus, I also wanted to make a website for anything and everything DS mode related, even for the Nintendo 3DS's TWL_FIRM. A guide on modding the Nintendo DSi was already made and Flipnote Lenny worked on a 3DS so I could use that as a base. I forked the repo, added the flashcart index above and redid some of the text. It was mine alright, but it was another website and not the main one people would link to. People would say my website is "out of date" imediately after making a PR changing a version of a software used, so it was clear no one wanted to help. Fine, I said. I'll host the flashcart section elsewhere but I'm still doing the DSi Guide changes.</p>
			<p>At the time, the site owner was literally no where to be found so it was up to RocketRobz and any other contributor to update it, and the means of updating it were....awful. Why is there two separate pages for installing unlaunch with only one step difference? Naturally, I fixed that and decided to do much more. It went to the point where I technically rewrote the whole website, accommodating the last year of non changes. Updated it to standards, removed a few useless parts, made it into my own style, etc.. Problem? It still wasn't my website. I couldn't put my name in the footer, the icon was still the icon that was made in two seconds and the repo was under someone who abandoned the guide.</p>
			<p>Then, out of literally nowhere, the site owner returned. She was nice, offering me half money of ads (which I think she might revoke for reasons listed later down), giving me write access to the repo & moving everything to a more streamlined place. Then, she wanted the guides to be consistent with the other cfw.guide websites, but the problem? The design philosophy that she wanted and the one within the community was vastly different.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>We already moved on from recommending hiyaCFW, due to not doing much.</li>
				<li>We would rather tell users outright if something is optional.</li>
				<li>We got rid of the Get Started button because people would click on it not reading the home page.</li>
				<li>We used tabs for things that don't require a separate page.</li>
				<li>We've decided to have anything pertaining to one application in that page dedicated to them.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Well, the guide was much more, er, streamlined and basically most of the hard work I've spent hours on got removed. Most of the changes had the reasoning of "I like this way" and "it works elsewhere". As I said before, I don't own the domain so I can't change it. The engine changes also reverted the website back to the old design language of Minimal Mistakes. For example, in the new Minimal Mistakes, topbar links were on the righthand side. This makes so much sense when you take into account that the "show more" button was also on the right hand side and this is also GBAtemp's old design too (which means that it was also used by Yamamura & MakerBoard). Well, it was reverted to be "consistent" with the other guides. She reverted it wrongly too, breaking the cross-compatibility and had CSS conflicts. When bringing up the point of it being next to the show more button, she said the "show more" button would rarely appear, and that's nice and all if you have a display that can accomodate all the links. It's even worse than how I did it since she added the TroubleShooting page to the top links and an uninstalling unlaunch page. With the exception of "FAQ", every link there has text of atleast 13 characters, so even on a 1920x1080 display, the show more button would pop up. 1080p is literally called High Definition, so what is the norm to view the site on? 2K and 4K?</p>
			<p>Might I add, that top links are supposed to accomodate the site in general, and they are what users see on every page. They are supposed to be easy links, and links people would often click on. Mario Making Mods had depot on the top bar since people would often check out the SMM mods. So why is the Uninstalling Unlaunch page on there? If it'd be shown on every screen, it would make people think "oh, why would I install it? It seems to be quite popular because its on the top bar". Well, to answer that? Because the design of the owner and the design of, basically the web, is different. The top bar links are supposed to be "add-on" sections for the guide, not things users would click on often. Well, first off, it's missing Unlaunch (installing it), hiyaCFW & File Extensions for Windows guides. Those are still considered addons. Secondly, even if it accomodate it all, that literally goes against most website design philosophies.</p>
			<p>What struck me the most was the removal of the footer credit only a few days after she said it's fine if my name was on the footer. The reason given was "it should be easy to find the site owner", yet I'm also the owner of the site since I maintained it while she was absent. But hey, it's her domain so I can't do anything...or could I? Why couldn't I repeat the Mario Making Mods situation, where I create my own domain? The situation is different though...</p>
			<p>The one mistake I made with Mario Making Mods was that there was a community split. No one not on the discord server knew we moved and any mention of me mentioning we moved was banned. I didn't want to do the same here, especially for a well-established community such as the Nintendo DSi Homebrew Scene. With the Super Mario Maker Modding scene, it just started two weeks prior so I could have taken a chance, but this guide was around since 2018. Basically, it was "You have money to buy a domain and you're first? Go ahead and you're basically owner of the guide community". Besides, the owner and I are a team and we still do work together. I shouldn't be salty over all my work being thrown out, and taking matters into my own hands would be a betrayal of her trust. With Mario Making Mods, the co-owner wanted to overthrow me from what was mine so I didn't care about being rude. This guide was never mine and the DSi Guide owner certainly has never done such mean things. I'm surprised she even sent me a FR on discord in the first place. Yes, this is useless complaining, but it only furthers my statement: What is considered ownership? All of it was revoked for "consistency" with other guides and for the changes that did remain, they weren't significant enough.</p>
			<h3>This blog</h3>
			<p>First off, I'm not talking about content. Content will always be mine and I wouldn't steal it. No point in doing so, since this is supposed to be NightScript's domain, not NightScript & co. I would get help writing a few things, but ideas are entirely mine. So what do I mean?</p>
			<p>Well, I mean the actual layout of the website itself. First off, the sidebar code originated from a template I found online and I heavily modified it. Only bits and pieces of the original is there. Have I properly rewrote the sidebar code?</p>
			<p>Then there's layout, and while I use Bootstrap, I also heavily based my design based on Midnight UI. I don't steal any of their code...but I also take everything from their design. Does that make it my website? The content is what matters, but the presentation too. It's weird for me to think this, because I haven't met any of them.</p>
			<h3>Discord Bots</h3>
			<p>Before we begin, please note that I will not be looking into every bot. Some of them (like Kurisu) have had hours of work spent into it and they couldn't copy paste because no other modding bot existed like Kurisu at the time of its development. I will, however, be looking at parts of Yamamura (my own Discord Bot) and over 122K bots hosted on BotGhost. Are those really your bots?</p>
			<p>Most discord bots are just front end to libraries. Discord.JS Music Bots? You connect to Youtube and then use Discord.JS's music player. You haven't done anything other than stitch things. BotGhost bots? It's literally pay them, select things from a menu and then your bot is there. Again, you haven't done anything. People who blindly follow video guides are even worse, since you are literally copy pasting from others. So what makes a Discord Bot yours in those instances?</p>
			<p>The fact that you control it. Yep, that's how all these above cases work. You get to control who uses it and who can't. Most users would call that a blacklist, but I call it theft. Who are you to decide who uses other peoples services? You haven't coded anything other than a frontend (probably stolen) for the service.</p>
			<p>To be fair, I'm guilty of this too. I never blacklisted anyone in Yamamura (though I was very close to doing so), but there are times where I would take someone elses code. The difference? I try to make it unique by introducing my own spins to it.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Image commands layered and properly resized.</li>
				<li>The poll command got many improvements to functionality.</li>
				<li>The initial points code was made by Hindsight. Samplasion and I introduced balancing of levels, switched to a new DB engine and much more.</li>
				<li>The video selection queue was complex and used a design language.</li>
				<li>In fact, most things have my unique design language, of having anything bonus in the embed with anything mandatory in the main message.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Main takeaway</h3>
			<p>In life, you'll always have to use something provided by someone else. Heck, to even access this page, you have to use external contributions (people who made CSS standards, people who built your device, people who built the OS, people who build the web browser, etc...). They made these things for you though. However, know what's yours, what isn't, and the definition of ownership.</p>
			<p>Personally, how have I changed? The Mario Making Mods website is now dead so shouldn't all the work go back to the person who made the Discord Server? Well, he didn't maintain it well, only had 20 members and ended up shutting down. I guess it would have happened to the true MMM if I didn't move it. Besides, his vision and mine were different, so I guess I could say that Bunten and I own Mario Making Mods properly. Now, you could still argue on the forum engine, but the forum engine was also changed from Blargboard to MakerBoard. Yes, MakerBoard is a fork, but I'd say that barely any of the original code remains; I changed it WAY too much. Either way, I've stopped PHP dev and if I wanted to make a website, I'd use Node.JS. Even if Node.JS were backwards compatible with PHP code, I would NOT use it. So, there's that in regards to forums in general.<br>
			The outcome regarding the individual users? I'm fine with the owner, but out of the 10 other staff members, only 2 of them are cool with me. Not once have the others tried to apologize. Well, I hope life takes them well enough, cause looking where they are right now, their situation aint pretty. One of them made a NSMBW mod which got criticizm the creator couldn't handle so they quit modding "forever". The second guy makes videos on Five Nights at Freddy and aims to make every character not scary from every series possible. The two who apologized? One makes music and plays geometry dash. The other makes music, turns out to be trans, plays through SMM levels as well as challenge vids and game mods daily. I've joined a few of their streams and I wish they would check the chat more often but they do have quite the following.</p>
			<p>Yamamura is right now in a state of limbo. Officially, I don't give support and I no longer host the bot, but someone could obviously rehost it. The parts that are mine? Yeah, I definitely want credit for all the work I've sinked it, but what really is mine and not? However, in a hypothetical situation where Yamamura would have continued on, that would no longer be an issue. Basically, I planned to code a rewrite where the backend (bot code) and the front end (Discord) were separate, so the bot would be able to be used on other platforms. It would also be in ES6 using modular import/export and not commonJS require. Both of those things would involve basically making the bot entirely from scratch with only a few things being able to have a direct port and those things would be extremely miniscule. I don't think that rewrite would ever happen though, since Yamamura won't officially come back any time soon.</p>
			<p>This website (and any type of website in general) is composed of both engine and content. I built the engine on top of the Bootstrap CSS framework and the sidebar code is barely recognizable to the original. For custom made things, however, I gave proper credit when applicable. Evie11 helped me with Apple and Mobile support specifically for the intents of this webiste, so they deserve all the credit they got in the website information page. Content is always my own, so I feel safe saying that I created and maintained ~97% of the website. Only things stopping me is the assistance from Evie and building the website on top of bootstrap v4, but at that point, it's fine to give credit. I already did most of the work so just credit the helpers and move on. It's useless to make a big deal over it.</p>
			<p>I sadly can't say anything about how dsi.cfw.guide would go. The spot the guide is currently going is where the original has existed for so long, on a better domain and is so prevalent that no one would use my version. Attempting to contribute to the main guide is meaningless since our design philosophies are different.</p>
			<p>How I will go about doing things in the future though is what can be improved. For DeadSkullzJr's website, I already self-made the engine. The only thing I took from others was the bootstrap container code for a slim web page contents. The rest is my own except the contents which is DeadSkullzJr. He already said we'll credit eachother fairly for the work we've both put in. This is as smooth as how it was for Samplasion and I in Yamamura and here's hoping to many more fun collaborations between individual developers.</p>
