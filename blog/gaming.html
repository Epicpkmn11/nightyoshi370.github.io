			<small class="font-italic font-weight-light font-underline">This is a Work In Progress</small><br><br>
			<p>When I have the time to play video games, I'd much prefer to play them on my laptop. It is the most versatile option available to playing games from different platform. The Lenovo Yoga 710, while objectively underpowered for complex gaming, can run applications like CEMU (a Nintendo Wii U emulator) quite well so it works for me. However, I have an Old Blue 3DS XL, a Purple DS Lite with a broken SLOT-1 loader (so I never use it except for DS Download Play) and a Nintendo Wii (which I never use but my step-brothers seem to adore). My step-brother lent me his Nintendo Switch but we don't have it anymore. So yeah, I'm quite the Nintendo fan. Actually, that would be incorrect; I'm more of a fan of old-school traditional game series. I don't like the hallway style of modern 3D games or the "shoot everything" design in the shooter games. I am, however, a fan of learning the games inside out to take advantage of any pro-level mechanic, like wave-dashing in Smash Bros (despite me unable to do so in Project Plus), or gaining momentum in the Classic-era Sonic games. You can read more about that in my blog entry where I talk about gaming.</p>
			<p>...are my favorite video game series of all time. My favorite entry in the Super Smash Bros. series is an unofficial modification of Super Smash Bros. Brawl called Project Plus. Being based on Project M, this modification brings back melee's design philosophy to make an extremely competitive game. Mechanics such as wave-dashing are back and each of the newcomers get their own interpretation of how they would act if they were in Melee. Cut characters return and already existing characters got their old moveset back. There is new content as well, such as Knuckles the Echidna being a playable character, more character costumes and every stage now having 3 variations, accessible by holding a button during the stage selection. It's the most content heavy Smash Bros game in the entire series, even surpassing the official entry with the headline "everything is here". The character I play differentiates between each game.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, I mainly play as King K Rool, Meta Knight & Mario.</li>
				<li>In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for the forgotten Nintendo console that got superseded by the switch, I mainly play as Bayonetta, Lucas, Sonic & Mario.</li>
				<li>In Project Plus, I mainly play as Ness but I can go to Wario as well. Sonic & Mario can be considered at times, but they're not as fun as their Smash 4 counterparts.</li>
				<li>In Super Smash Flash 2, I play as Meta Knight and Sonic. Mario too, but he's not as fun as his Smash 4 counterpart.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Those are the four Smash Bros games I look back too. Smash 64 doesn't have enough content and everything good about Brawl and Melee is merged into Project Plus. Each and every one of these games have something to make it different.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Want the latest official Smash game with every character from every official smash game? Go with Ultimate</li>
				<li>Want to play Smash Run, a fun side-game where you collect stats for four minutes until you go into a big battle with everyone else? Go to Smash 3DS.</li>
				<li>Want to have a fun story mode with all your favorite Nintendo characters? Brawl is the game for you (but play Project Plus so it doesn't feel slow paced).</li>
				<li>Want to play extremely competitively with a bunch of extremely advanced techniques, yet an awful roster due to clone characters? Melee is the game for you (Project Plus has the tech but without the filler content).</li>
				<li>Don't care about what's going on in school and just want to play Smash Bros? Super Smash Flash 2 is the game to play.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>What I love about Smash Bros is how it takes iconic characters (and the 8 Marths that Nintendo just loves so much) and puts them against eachother in a Nintendo-esque way. Rather than having health bars and bordered walls, it takes a much more casual approach. Even though I think they took the casual market too far in regular Brawl, it's a much more inviting game than standard fighting games. Regardless of its casual approach, it is still considered a fighting series with people competing against other players. I wish I was next to people like ZeRo and MKLeo, but I like the way I play right now. Maybe later down the road I'll learn how to wave-dash, L Cancel and do all these techniques. For now though, I guess I will take Super Smash Bros' competitive scene at the slow pace I'm taking it right now.</p>
			<p>In the Classic 2D Sonic games, the more you memorize the level, the better you know the fastest way to go through an act. The goal is to get the fastest times in an act, and that concept is the only type of replayability I ever need. Green Hill Zone, despite being hated on for its constant return in Modern Sonic games, is a perfect example of this design philosophy. There is no need to hunt down collectable by searching every pipe or randomly crouching through hidden walls. Now, that might make me seem like I hate other 2D platformer series, but that couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
			<p>Kirby is a series intended for easier players with design philosophies such as infinite flight and the relatively slow gameplay. Here's an example of the slow gameplay kirby has to offer: Rather than curling up into a super fast blue ball or timing your jump to hit their heads, kirby defeats his enemies by coming to a complete stand-still and sucking them up. The games compliment this new-player philosophy with collectables, and it makes sense for a series this laid back. For example, The Great Cave Offensive sub-game in Kirby Super Star Ultra (and the original respectively) does everything to complement the Kirby nature despite its name and Smash Bros stage representation doing anything but. While not a requirement, there are 60 collectables scattered throughout your journey to travel out of the cave. With Kirby, this type of system works phenomunously as it opens the gates to all players. If you're a new person just getting into video games, it's quite straight forward and easy to play through. However, it's copycat mario doesn't really have that much of a good time.</p>
